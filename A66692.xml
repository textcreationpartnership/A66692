            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>IN the Eaſt part of <hi>England,</hi> as in reſpect of the Metropolis thereof <hi>London,</hi> in that County formerly inhabited by the <hi>Trinobantes,</hi> afterwards poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the <hi>East-Saxons,</hi> from whom it derived to <hi>Eaſt-ſex,</hi> ſince by Corruption, or rather for the more eaſier Pronunciation <hi>Eſſex:</hi> In a Town thereof called <hi>Billerecay,</hi> not many years ago, there lived a Farmer named <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſio,</hi> one whoſe Means, as they were too low to make him envied, ſo were they too high to cauſe Scorn, enjoying a Mediocrity betwixt Riches and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, that as he was no Gentleman to live on his Lands, yet adding Induſtry to his ſmall Stock, he had moſt commonly Mony in his Pocket, when others who made a braver ſhow were without. In his younger Years he married the Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton of <hi>Burſted</hi>'s Daughter, a Man of ſuch Strength, that according to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of that place, he would Threſh as much Wheat in one day, as another Man could do in two; and which is further remembred of him, that at a Match of Foot-ball, plaid betwixt that Village and the neighbouring Hamlet, by his alone Manhood and Proweſs the Victory was clearly obtain'd of his ſide. We are the willinger to mention theſe things, becauſe the Reader may underſtand, that the Perſon of whom we intend to treat of, was deſcended from couragious adventurous Perſons.</p>
               <p>Now four times had <hi>Hiem</hi>'s Froſts bereav'd the Farth of her Summers Livery, and as many times had Lady <hi>Flora</hi> beſtowed on <hi>Tellus</hi> a Suit of curious embroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd Tapiſtry, ſince the Nuptials were celebrated betwixt <hi>Thomaſio</hi> and his loving Conſort; during which time he had, by his Induſtry, much increaſed that little Stock he began with; nothing now ſo much perplex'd him, as the want of an Heir, on whom to beſtow this parſel of Eſtate, if Death ſhould Summon him to his Grave: At laſt, to his exceeding Joy, his Wife prov'd to be with Child, and in proceſs of time was deliver'd of a goodly Boy, who was Chriſten'd by the Name of <hi>William.</hi> This Child, as he was long in coming, ſo was he the more welcome unto them, and ſo much the rather, becauſe that <hi>Lucy</hi> (ſo was his Wife named) was now ſo ſtricken in Years, that he had little hopes of having another; wherefore he reſolved to beſtow ſome Coſt on the bringing up of his Son <hi>Billy,</hi> his ambitious Thoughts ſoared ſo high, that he ſwore by his Plow-ſhare if his Son lived, he would make him a Schollard, not only to write and read ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, but if need were to make a Bill or a Bond, and to write a Letter, that he might not be beholding to the Vicar of the Pariſh upon every occaſion: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, no ſooner had his Son come to ſome Maturity of Knowledge, but he bought him a Horn-book, and put him to School to an Old Woman that lived in an Alms-houſe, who ſo indoctrinated him, that in a ſhort time he had learned the Criſs-croſs-row, which made <hi>Thomaſio</hi> think his Penny a Week well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108980:3"/>on him, ſo that he told his Son, If he proved a good Boy, when he had learn'd his Horn-book, he would buy him a Golden Primmer; nay, that he ſhould likewiſe have a Plum-cake into the bargain; which ſo encourag'd young <hi>Billy,</hi> that in a ſhort time he claimed his Father's Promiſe, for he was now in the laſt line of that Folio book. Whereupon <hi>Thomaſio</hi> going to the Market, after dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent enquiry for ſuch a Volume, he at laſt did light on one according to his hearts deſire, on the cover whereof was pictur'd St. <hi>George</hi> a conquering the Dragon, the ſight whereof did no doubt implant in young <hi>Billy</hi>'s Heart the Seeds of Valour and Heroick Thoughts, and prognoſticated to the World what a Champion this would prove, whoſe valorous Acts ſhould afterwards be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd by Fames golden Trumpet, and fill each corner of the habitable Earth with the Report of his deſerved Praiſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Billy</hi> now plyed his Book with might and main, having gotten to the end of the ſame, before others who began with him had attained half way; and now to encourage him the more, his Father bought him ſeveral Ballads, as of <hi>Fair</hi> Roſamond, <hi>The Blind Beggar of</hi> Bednal Green, <hi>King</hi> Edward <hi>the Fourth and the Tanner,</hi> &amp;c. but amongſt them all, none of them pleaſed <hi>Billy</hi> ſo well, as the Song of that Arch Pyrate Sir <hi>Andrew Barton,</hi> and that Heroick Poem of <hi>Chevy-Chaſe,</hi> of which laſt the worthy Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> uſed to ſay, That the hearing thereof (though Sung no better than by a Country Crowd) ſtirred up his Heart more than a Trumpet; well therefore might it be a great Motive to <hi>Billy</hi> to undertake ſuch high Adventures, as afterwards (God willing) we ſhall declare unto you.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Billy</hi> will be no longer under the Tuition of a Dame, as knowing by natural Inſtinct, that a Womans Domination is moſt Imperious; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Father provides him a School-maſter, one <hi>Snip</hi> a Taylor, who for his Dexterity in Singing, was advanced to the Dignity of Church-Clerk of the Pariſh; which Office, and keeping of a School, found him with Powder'd-Beef, and the Vales of his Trade furniſhed him with Cabbage. Two Years went <hi>Billy</hi> to School with this Maſter, in which ſpace of time he had learn'd to read ſo well, as gave his Father extraordinary content, ſo that now he buys <hi>Billy</hi> a choice Library of Books, <hi>viz. The Hiſtory of</hi> Tom Thumb, Robin <hi>Good-fellow, The Fryer and the Boy, The Three Merry Wives of</hi> Green-Gooſe-Fair, <hi>The Sackfull of News, A Hundred Merry Tales,</hi> &amp;c. And now he thinks his Son ſufficiently provided for Learning as concerning the Reading part, his next care is, to learn him to Write and caſt Account, and then he fears not but he may live in any place in <hi>England;</hi> yea, and if that the Stars ſhould be propitious to him, he might in time be advanced to a Juſtice of the Peace his Clerk: Therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Snip</hi> could not write, he intreated the Vicar of the Pariſh to take ſome pains with his Son, and if he made <hi>Billy</hi> as cunning at his Pen, as he himſelf was at his Plough, he promiſed him to Fallow his Glebe Land for him for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: Upon theſe Conſiderations the Vicar took <hi>Billy</hi> under his Tuition, but adviſed <hi>Thomaſio,</hi> that whilſt his Son learned to write, that he might not in the mean time forget his Reading, to buy him ſome pretty Books to read in, which might draw him thereto with ſome delight. <hi>Thomaſio</hi> replied, He had been at great Charges that way already, but for his Sons good, he would not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108980:3"/>ſtick out for a ſmall matter. So the next Fair, taking his Son along with him for the choice of his Volumes, at a Pedlars Stall he bought him theſe Books following:

               <p>
                  <hi>Billy</hi> was not a little brag of his Books, for he imagined he had now as good a Library as the beſt Scholar in Chriſtendom; but nothing tickled his Fancy ſo much in the reading of them, as thoſe Romantick Stories of killing Gyants and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, which many times did ſo far tranſport him, that he thought himſelf to be really engaged in theſe imaginary Fights; and ſo intent were his Thoughts upon them, that Death's image ſleep could not divert him; ſo that when <hi>Morpheus,</hi> with his leaden Mair, had knock'd down others a ſleep in their Beds, the Thoughts of theſe ſtrange Adventures did ſo run in his Head, that he would riſe in his ſleep, and getting a Bed-ſtaff in his hand, lay about him as if he were mad, imagining he had encountred with ſome Gyant, or other ſtrange Monſter. The Servants that lay in the ſame Room with him, being diſturbed thus with his Fegaries, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to their Maſter, who thereupon chid his Son, telling him, That <hi>People which laboured hard, muſt not be diſturb'd of their natural Reſt, for by that means they could not perform their work.</hi> And therefore he threatned him, If he plaid any more ſuch Pranks, he would not only put him to Plow, but alſo take all his Books from him; for he imagined it was his Books that wrought that Indiſpoſition in him. Yet notwithſtanding all his Threatnings, <hi>Billy</hi>'s mind did ſo run of his Knightly Atchievements, that he ſtill continued in his old courſe, for one night dreaming he was encountring with a terrible Dragon, he got up in his ſleep, and taking the Bed-ſtaff in his hand, began to lay about him according to his old manner. Now it ſo chanced, that thorough often redoubling his blows, he at laſt ſtruck the Plow-man ſuch a blow on the Pate, that the Blood trickled down his Ears. The Plow-man being betwixt ſleeping and waking, feeling the ſmart of the blow, ſtarted
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108980:4"/>out of his Bed, and taking a Plow whip in his hand, which ſtood up there ready in a corner, he began to exerciſe the ſame on <hi>Billy</hi>'s body, laying it on ſo foundly, that had <hi>Billy</hi> been in ſuch a ſleep as St. <hi>David</hi> the Champion of <hi>Wales</hi> was, in the inchanted Garden of <hi>Ormondine,</hi> yet muſt the ſmart thereof needs have waked him; but <hi>Billy</hi> took all patiently, imagining it to be the blows of the Dragon's Tail; having read that Knights Errant are ſubject to ſuch Adventures. And now the Plow-man being weary of belabouring him, went to Bed; <hi>Billy</hi> alſo return'd to his Cabbin, but the ſmart of his blows were ſuch, as would not ſuffer him to ſleep one wink all that night; enough to have ſpoil'd a young Knight Errant, had not his mind been ſo fully fixed on Knightly Adventures.</p>
               <p>Next Morning <hi>Billy</hi> was ſo ſoar that he could not go to School, and being ask'd how he came to be ſo, he told them, <hi>It was with encountring of a mighty Dragon, whilſt he uttempted to reſcue a King's Daughter that was bound to a Stake:</hi> And ſo run on in a wild Diſcourſe, what a terrible Duel he had with him, according as he had read in the ſeven Champions, of the Combat there betwixt St. <hi>George</hi> and the Dragon. But his Father underſtanding, by his Plow-man's broken Pate, what Whimſies ſtill poſſeſſed his Son's Noddle, repented him that ever he had put him to School, and accurſed the time that ever he bought him theſe Books, the original cauſe, as he imagined, of <hi>Billy</hi>'s Diſtemper; and ſo in a Rage, getting all his Books tegether, the Knights and the Gyants had been all burnt in one Bon-fire, had not <hi>Billy</hi> with Tears, and his Wife <hi>Lucy</hi> with Intreaties, reſcu'd them out his hands.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Billy,</hi> inſtead of going to School, is put to keep Sheep, which he liked far better than going to Plow, becauſe he had read of ſome Kings and famous Knights that had been Shepherds, but in all his Romances (by which he was ſolely directed) he had never read of any one of them that ever held Plow. In this lazy kind of Life he had leiſure more than enough to peruſe his Romances over a-freſh, in which he neglected no time; ſo that he could give a perfect account of each particular in any of theſe books. And now weighing with himſelf what immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Fame thoſe Knights had gained, he reſolved to become a Knight Errant himſelf, being now (as he thought) of ſtrength and Age ſufficient enough to cope with any Gyant, yea, though he were as big as Sir <hi>Aſcapart</hi> is deſcribed in <hi>Bevis</hi> of <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton,</hi> or <hi>Colbrand</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> whom <hi>Guy</hi> of <hi>Warwick</hi> ſlew.</p>
               <p>But conſidering with himſelf, that a Knight without a Lady is like Ling without Muſtard, or a Bag-pudding without Suet, he therefore began to think on what Female he ſhould place his Affection, at laſt he reſolved on a luſty ſtrapping Wench, a neighbouring Farmer's Daughter, one who for her heighth might have been Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to <hi>Long Meg</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and as ſmall in the Waſte as a Mill-poſt in the middle, ſuch a one as the conceited Fellow could by no means be perſwaded to marry, alledging, That of Evils the leaſt is ſtill to be choſen; but Fancy that Loves without ſhewing reaſon why, preſented her to <hi>Billy</hi> as the Phenix of the Age, and therefore he reſolved that ſhe, and none but ſhe, ſhould be the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of his Affections. But her Name being <hi>Joan Grumball,</hi> he thought was too mean for her, now that ſhe was to act her part on the Theatre of Honour; he therefore took the ſame liberty as Cardinals do when they are elected Pope, to change their Name, and reſolved in his thoughts, that henceforward ſhe ſhould be called <hi>The Fair Dulcina;</hi> and now his thoughts are wholly fixed on Love,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108980:4"/>wherefore in imitation of thoſe Amouriſts he had read of in his Romances, he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents Solitary places, wrings his hands, and exclaims bitterly on <hi>Cupid</hi> for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him into that miſerable Thraldom. <hi>O impetuous Love</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>with what heavy burdens doſt thou load thy poor Vaſſals? How hard are thy Dictates, and how intricate the Meanders thou bringeſt thy Captives into? O pierce the Heart of that cruel fair One, that ſhe may at laſt conſider of the Miſeries that I endure for her ſake; but thou art Deaf as well as Blind, and will not, or rather canſt not hear: For how can we imagine thee to be a God, who art ſo unjuſt in all thy Actions, to fire the Breaſt of one, and freeze the other; to make her Heart more obdurate and harder than the Adamant, and mine like Wax, fit to receive any Impreſſion thou art pleaſed to put upon it. O</hi> Dulcina, <hi>the only Joy of my Heart, aſſure thy ſelf that no Mortal Man whatſoever, is, or can be, ſo much thy Servant and Slave as my ſelf.</hi> Then concluding with a Sigh for its period, he would again wring his hands, throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the Ground, and make ſuch ſad Faces, that had <hi>Dulcina</hi> ſeen him, ſhe could not chuſe but have melted into Compaſſion, even as a pound of Butter doth melt with the heat of the Fire.</p>
               <p>But as this Paſſion of Love maketh ſome wiſe Men mad, ſo doth it again quicken and revive the Wits of others, making their Fancies ſoar in a higher pitch than ordinary, as may appear by this our <hi>Billy,</hi> who though of himſelf as dull a Clod of Earth as ever <hi>Prometheus</hi> put fire into, yet being thus wrap'd up in Love, as a Baby in Blankets, he grew very Poetical, and taking Pen and Paper in hand, writ theſe lines following in praiſe of his <hi>Dulcina.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Billy</hi> was not a little proud of his Verſes, for he conceited himſelf to be near as good a Poet as a Knight Errant, and yet he thought withal, that he could not well be the one without being the other, they being two as inſeparable Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions as a Whore and the Pox. And now having proceeded thus far in his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his next Care was, how to get a Squire, for a Knight-Errant without a Squire, is like powder'd Beef without Muſtard: He therefore conſider'd with himſelf, he muſt of neceſſity be furniſhed that way, not only to have a Companion in his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, but alſo to be a witneſs of his Valour, and upon occaſion to ſend on an Errand to the Lady of his Affections, according as he had read that Knights-Errant for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had done. Much were his Thoughts perplexed in the choice of a fit Perſon for this purpoſe, ſometimes pitching upon one, and then upon more ſerious Thoughts, rejecting him and fixing on another, being more curious in his Choice, than many a Man is in chuſing of his Wife: At laſt he reſolved upon one that was his Father's Taskers Son, and getting him one day to help him Fold his Sheep, he there imparted his mind to him, telling him ſuch Rhodomantado Stories of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering Kingdoms and Iſlands, and Captivating Gyants and Monſters; and how after all theſe Victories, that he himſelf ſhould be Crowned King of ſome great Country, when he would make him a petty King or Vice-Roy under him; that the young Man was eaſily induced to condeſcend unto his Motion. So agreeing to be as ſecret in the buſineſs as they could, that their Fathers might not come to have any knowledge thereof, for ſpoiling their Preferment. Having Folded their Sheep, they departed home, intending to put their Reſolutions into action as ſoon as might be.</p>

               <p>NOW were <hi>Billy</hi> and his Squire very buſie in providing Materials for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Journey, when their Deſign had like to have been quite ſpoiled by an unexpected Accident, which came to paſs as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Billy,</hi> according to his wonted courſe, frequenting Solitary places, and bitterly exclaiming againſt the Tyrannies of <hi>Cupid,</hi> was one day over-heard by a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Farmer, who ſearching for ſome ſtray'd Sheep, was by that means brought into that uncouth place, where he heard <hi>Billy</hi> to make this ſad Relation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O</hi> Dulcina, <hi>the Joy of my Heart! How doth the Remembrance of thee add new Life to my drooping Spirits? O ſooner ſhall the Sea ceaſe to Ebb and Flow, or</hi> Hyperion <hi>to run his daily courſe, than I ſhall ceaſe to be Faithful to thee! What though</hi> Jaſon <hi>was Falſe to</hi> Medea, <hi>and</hi> Paris <hi>to</hi> Oenone! <hi>Yet never ſhall it be ſaid that thy Knight did prove diſloyal, that</hi> Billy <hi>was falſe to his</hi> Dulcina. <hi>No; know I will be as true to thee, as St.</hi> George <hi>was to his</hi> Sabra, Guy <hi>of</hi> Warwick <hi>to his Fair</hi> Phelice, <hi>or</hi> Bevis <hi>of</hi> Southampton <hi>to</hi> Joſiana. <hi>O how I long to make thy Name renowned by the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108980:5"/>Deeds of arms which I ſhall perform, that Babes unborn in time to come may read in Books, thoſe valiant Acts which I ſhall do for thy ſake! O how many Thouſand Pagans ſhall I deſtroy, and ſet their Cities on flames of Fire, like the Battlements of</hi> Troy, <hi>and make their blood run down the Channels, and all for the love of my</hi> Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina! <hi>But thou alas regardeſt not my Love, but art as deaf to my complaints, as the hard-hearted Creditor is to his poor Debtor.</hi> O Dulcina! Dulcina! <hi>the faireſt Wench that ever trod upon Shooe of Leather, regard my moan, and pitty the ſad pains that I endure for thy ſake. O be as kind to me as</hi> Roſalinde <hi>was to St.</hi> Denys <hi>the French Champion, or the fair</hi> Jew <hi>to St.</hi> Jame's <hi>the Champion of</hi> Spain. Then taking the verſes out of his pocket, which he had made in the praiſe of his <hi>Dulcina,</hi> he repeated them with ſuch a groan, as if ſhe had been the only Goddeſs in the World worthy to be ador'd. The Farmer who ſtood all this while unſeen to mark his diſcourſe, hearing him talk of <hi>Gyants</hi> and <hi>Champions</hi> and Streams of Blood, was ſtruck into a marvellous amazement; but at laſt hearing him to repeat the Verſes, he conceited with himſelf that he was infected with an itch of poſy, which he judged to be far worſe than the Plague; and therefore went and told <hi>Thomaſio,</hi> that his Son was turned a Poet, but that he might as good almoſt ſee him hang'd, for he would never be worth a Groat as long as he lived. <hi>Now by my Dun-Cow</hi> (ſaid <hi>Thomaſio</hi>) <hi>I prethee Neighbour tell me what theſe Boets be? in Vaith</hi> (ſaith the Farmer,) <hi>they are a ſtrange kind of People, who if they get a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in their Pocket (for they ſeldom can reach above ſuch a Sum) they never leave till they have ſpent ten Pence out of it: They are very dry Fellows, for they can never quench their thirſt with drinking: And though by reaſon of their Poverty few Engliſh Women will have them, yet they ſay they are wedded to nine Outlandiſh wenches whem they call Muſes. They talk of a great deal of land they have lies in a place called</hi> Pernaſſus-hill, <hi>but by my ſay I believe it is but barren ſtuff, for never an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurer will lend a farthing on morgage on it, elſe ſure it had been all forfeited long ago; Sometimes perhaps a Gentleman will lend a half Crown or Five Shillings upon it, but no ſooner is that Mony ſpent, but they will Morgage it to another, which makes me Wonder how theſe Gentlemen are Cheated, becauſe they ſhow them Writings; But I'll warrant ye they never get a Penny of a Lawyer, for they are too cunning to be Cheated with ſuch Noninoes; and yet ne're ſtir, ſometimes they make ſuch Plaguy Songs, that when they are Sung in our Market, they make the Maids to melt like the butter in their basket to hear them: but as ſure as Eggs with too long Boyling will prove to be hard, they have but little or nothing for the making of them, for a new Suit on their Backs is as ſtrange as to meet with Froſty weather at Midſummer; So that if you would never ſo fain be revenged on them, their Coats are ſo thin, they will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a bruſhing: nor is it to any purpoſe to Sue them at Law, for they are indebted Twenty Shillings more than they are worth at the Ale-Houſe. By my Hallidame</hi> (ſaid <hi>Thomaſio</hi>) <hi>if I thought my Son</hi> Billy <hi>would prove ſuch a Boet, I ſhould heartily wiſh he had never been Born; but now I think on't, I have a trick in my head that I believe will Spoil his Rimeing, I will take him away from keeping of Sheep, and ſet him to Threſhing, and Forceing him to work hard from Morning till Night, I warrant you he will have but little Mind of makeing of Verſes. Indeed</hi> (ſaid his Neighbour,) <hi>you have hit the Nail on the head, for I tell ye, this Poetry proceeds all from Idleneſs, for I that was brought up hard to work, did neve make a Verſe in all my Life; But I wonder why at firſt you would beſtow ſo much learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108980:6"/>on him, for though a little be not amiſs, to read now and then a Chapter to drive away the time, yet you will find, that if once they go any further, the more Bookiſh the more Blockiſh: for then go about to learn them how to hold Plough, and as good go about to empty our Horſe-Pond with a ſpoon. Therefore I adviſe ye Neighbour to do as you ſay, and you will ſoon ſee that working hard will put him quite beſides his Poetry.</hi>

               <p>Accordingly the next morning <hi>Billy</hi> was ſet to Threſhing, and ſo narrowly looked to for plying his Work, that he had no breathing time for his Love Sick Fancies, and quite took off the edge of his Stomack for Verſefying: his whole care and ſtudy being now how to get himſelf rid of this thraldom, that he might go in perſuit of his Knightly adventures, and Fortune, that ever favours noble En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes, ſoon put a golden opportunity into his hand, for his Father was to go to <hi>London</hi> to pay his <hi>Rent,</hi> which with ſome other buſineſs that he had would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him there the ſpace of three days. <hi>Billy</hi> reſolving to let no more time ſlip, now that Fortune was ſo favourable to him, acquaints his Squire <hi>Ricardo</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, bidding him to provide his things ready, for Fame called aloud unto them to haſten, and injur'd Ladys and wronged Captives cryed for help from his victorious arm; wherefore as ſoon as his Father was ſet out on his Journey, they began to prepare for theirs; and going firſt into the ſtable, they ſingled out two of the ableſt Plough-Horſes, whom Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> now that they were preferred to be Horſes of Service, changed their names from <hi>Brown</hi> and <hi>Bayard,</hi> by which they were before called, unto the more ſtately names of <hi>Belerophon</hi> and <hi>Pugnoto,</hi> chuſing <hi>Belerophon</hi> to ride on himſelf, and beſtowing <hi>Pugnoto</hi> upon his Squire.</p>
               <p>Their next care was for Armor for themſelves, and that had the Queen of <hi>Chance</hi> provided ready for them to their hands, for <hi>Thomaſio</hi> being Conſtable of the Pariſh, the Town Arms for the Trained Bands was laid up in his Houſe, with which they armed themſelves <hi>Cap-a-pe;</hi> but their chiefeſt care was in the choice of their Swords, not minding ſo much for the defence of themſelves, as for weapons wherewith to offend their enemies: they therefore choſe two <hi>Bilbo</hi> blades, hand broad, ſuch as would cut off a Gyants head at one Blow; and now a new thought came into <hi>Billy's</hi> head, by what name to call his Sword, becauſe it was proper for a Knight Errants Sword to have a name; but after he had Scratched his head a little, it came into his Pate and ſo the Sword was icleped <hi>Roſero.</hi> Their Launces were two Pikes, cut in two by the middle; and for other weapons or accoutrements they reſted contented, till ſuch time their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood could purchaſe them better. <hi>Ricardo</hi> was very importunate to carry a Wallet of Victuals along with them, but Sir <hi>Billy</hi> told him it was againſt the Law of Arms for Knights Errant to carry with them any Mony or Victuals, they being to be provided for at every Caſtle they came unto.</p>
               <p>It was at that time of the year when theſe Champions ſet forth, that <hi>Ceres</hi> had Cloathed the earth with a rich Suit of all Sorts of grain, and that the full ears began to humble their flowry tops as in a graceful acknowledgment to thank the Husbandman for his painful Toyle. Now that they might not be ſeen, they ſet forth in the night time, when by the next morning at ſuch time as <hi>Aurora</hi> had opened her purple Doors, and gave notice of the approach of <hi>Titan,</hi> they were gotten from Home the ſpace of Twelve Miles, not minding whether they went,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108980:6"/>but only ſo that they went forwards. It happened that in their way was a field of ſtanding Wheat, in which the owner had placed a great Scare-Crow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Pole to Frighten the Birds from eating his Corn; this being placed of a good height, and being of as terrible a ſhape as they could make it, <hi>Billy</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to be a Gyant, and therefore with a loud voice thus ſpake unto it; <hi>Thou</hi> Blanderon, Colebrand, Amarant, Aſcapart, <hi>or what ever elſe thy name be, I Charge thee to come and humble thy ſelf before the worthy Knight Errant Sir</hi> Billy <hi>of</hi> Billerecay, <hi>or look for what my Conquering Arm ſhall do unto thee.</hi> But ſeeing the Scare-Crow returned him no anſwer, he in a furious mood ſet Spurs to his Horſe, and with his Launce bare the Scare-Crow to the ground, which in its fall tumbling before his Horſe, the Horſe ſtumbling thereat, came over and over with Sir <hi>Billy.</hi> In the mean time the Farmer and his Son who owned this Corn chanced to come by, who ſeeing his Wheat thus Shamefully ſpoyled, far more than the Birds could have done hurt, take up the quarrel of his Scare-Crow, he with a good Battoon laid upon the Ribs of Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> who was ſcarcely able to ſtand, being much bruiſed with the fall of his Horſe. But <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſeeing his Maſter thus roughly handled, thought it was his Duty to take his part, and therefore with his piece of Pike, which he called a Launce, running with his Horſe furiouſly at the Farmer, and miſſing of him, with the force which he uſed puſhed himſelf clear over his Horſes Head; The Farmers Son ſeeing them thus bent upon miſchief, and (as he thought) more upon Spight to do them an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, than any skill they had in doing it, having a good luſty Aſhen Towel in his hand, he fell a Rib-roaſting of <hi>Ricardo,</hi> who feeling the blows Smart, bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed like a Town Bull; Sir <hi>Billy</hi> hearing this loud out cry of his Squire, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were Soundly paid off himſelf, yet called to <hi>Ricardo,</hi> and told him, <hi>it was againſt the Law of Arms to ask his Enemy Mercy. What tell you me of Arms</hi> (ſaid <hi>Ricardo</hi>) <hi>when he hath ſo beaten me, that I believe I ſhall never be able again to lift my Arms up to my Head.</hi> The Farmer and his Son, upon theſe words, ſtayed their hands, demanding them the reaſon why they had without any cauſe given, ſo trampled upon and ſpoyled their Corn? <hi>Tell me</hi> (ſaid Sir <hi>Billy</hi>) <hi>what Gyant was that I overcame, and by what ſpells and Negromantick Charms you have cauſed me and my Squire to undergo theſe blows we have felt? which if you refuſe to do, I ſweare by the River of</hi> Styx, <hi>and by the Honour of all Knight Errants that ever were yet in the World, I will make you ſuch an example to poſterity, that Babes unborn, in recounting the miſeries of unfortunate People, ſhall uſe your names for a Memorial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Farmer and his Son by his Diſcourſe judged him to be Frantick, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expecting no other Satisfaction for their Corn, but what they ſhall have by beating them, began a-freſh to Baſtinado them, ſo that <hi>Ricardo</hi> cryed out, <hi>Murther, Murther;</hi> But Sir <hi>Billy</hi> thinking it all to be done by Inchantment, took it very Patiently. At length the old man having more compaſſion than his Son, deſiſted from ſtriking, and <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſeeing a little breathing ſpace, got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as faſt as he could, leaving his Maſter to ſhift for himſelf, who alſo getting up his Horſe as well as his batterd Body was able, and muttering terrible impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catious againſt Negromancers and Inchanters, he rode after <hi>Ricardo,</hi> whom he much blamed for deſerting him in ſuch an Honourable encounter. <hi>I cannot tell</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:108980:7"/>(ſaid <hi>Ricardo</hi>) <hi>but I think in ſuch Encounters there is more Blows than Honour to be gotten, and therefore my Council is, that we return home again, and leave this work of killing Gyants and Monſters, to thoſe who have nothing elſe to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words ſo angred Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> that in a great rage he ſaid; <hi>O thou lump of Ignorance, canſt thou imagine that Honour is to be gotten by lying in Bed? No; That is a thing which is to be attained by Difficulties and dangers.</hi> Didſt not thou ſee how I made the Gyant to fall before my Victorious arm? <hi>What Gyant</hi> (ſaid <hi>Ricardo</hi>) <hi>I ſaw nothing but only a Scare-Crow, and would to God it had ſtood there ſtill although it had been the strongeſt Gyant that ever was made to Scare away Birds. This</hi> (ſaid Sir <hi>Billy</hi>) <hi>cometh by thy Ignorance in Books of Chevalry, I tell thee that which thou tookeſt for a Scare-Crow, was the tall and terrible Gyant</hi> Blanderon; <hi>but theſe things are done by Negromancy, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why we ſuffered theſe Blows in this firſt encounter, was becauſe I have not received the order of Knighthood, for in all Books of Chevalry whatſoever, we never do read that ever any Gyant did beat a Knight Errant, but that always the Knight did beat the Gyant: And therefore I am reſolved, that at the first Caſtle I come to, I will requeſt to be made a Knight by the Lord thereof; which is a thing that ought not to be denyed to thoſe who have ſworn themſelves true Sons of</hi> Mars, <hi>and ſpend their Blood in relieving diſtreſſed Ladies, and thoſe that are oppreſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ricardo</hi> was very hard to be perſwaded, (for it was then about the time when Mortals uſed to break their faſts, and his cuſtom uſed to be rather to neglect his work than the ſatisfying of his Stomach.) Had not the great hopes of his Maſters being ſuddenly Knighted, and the entertainment he ſhould have at the next Caſtle, diverted him; And to ſee that fortune is ſometimes Favourable to Knights Errant, they had not rid long before they came to a ſumptuous building, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in lived an ancient <hi>Eſquire,</hi> who kept a very bountiful Houſe, and courteouſly entertained ſtrangers that came to him. Thither rid Sir <hi>Billy</hi> and his Squire, and meeting one of the Servants in the Yard, asked him if the Lord of the Caſtle was within? The Servant ſtared upon them, ſeeing them ſo Ridiculouſly habited, and ſeeing Sir <hi>Billy</hi> have on ſome pieces of Armor, which he had never ſeen before; but only ſuch as hung up in his Maſters Hall. <hi>I tell you</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>this is no Caſtle, nor is my Maſter any Lord, ſave only that he is Lord of the Mannor. I perceive</hi> (ſaid Sir <hi>Billy</hi>) <hi>that thou art ignorant of what belongeth to Knights Errant, and therefore go tell thy Maſter, that the moſt Heroick and invincible Knight, Sir</hi> Billy <hi>of</hi> Billerecay, <hi>would confer with him. Tell me then</hi> (quoth the Fellow) <hi>how long thou and the Springal that tendeth on thee, have been come out of</hi> Sedlam, <hi>and perhaps I may acquaint him with your being here, elſe may my Maſter be angry with me, for of all ſcents, he loveth not that which comes out of</hi> Bedlam. Theſe words put Sir <hi>Billy</hi> in a great rage, drawing out his <hi>Morglay,</hi> and Brandiſhing it about his head, that he looked like the picture of St. <hi>George</hi> fighting with the Dragon. The Fellow ſeeing him draw out his <hi>Killing Iron,</hi> knowing it to be dangerous meddling with edge Tools, told him he would preſently acquaint his Maſter; <hi>But Sir</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>my memory is bad, and therefore I muſt intreat you once more to tell me your name. I tell thee</hi> (ſaid <hi>Billy,</hi>) <hi>It is the Victorious Knight Errant, Sir</hi> Billy <hi>of</hi> Billerecay. <hi>A killing name, and a killing look,</hi> (ſaid the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108980:7"/>Fellow) I doubt my Maſter will be <hi>afraid, but yet for my own Safety I will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to tell him.</hi> So going into the Houſe, he found him Diſcourſing with Gentlemen, to whom he ſaid, <hi>Sir, there is without the Vincible Knight, Sir</hi> Billy <hi>of</hi> Billerecay, <hi>deſires to confute with ye.</hi> The Gentleman laughing at his ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, looked out to ſee what great <hi>Don</hi> this ſame ſhould be; But when they ſaw two ſuch Anticks, clad in patches of Armour like <hi>Mars</hi> his petty-toes, they could not contain, but were ready to burſt with laughter at ſuch a ridiculous ſight; And therefore expecting to find rare ſport in their converſation, they went all forth to give him Entertainment, whom Sir <hi>Billy</hi> accoſted in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SIR, I am one, who for the publick good have taken upon me the Exerciſe of Arms, for to revive the Honour of</hi> Knight Errantry, <hi>which too-long hath lain neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in the world, to the great prejudice of diſtreſſed Damoſels, wronged Ladies, and Captived Knights; and how ſince the World hath been Peſtered with Gyants, Monſters, and Inchanters, there is none can be ignorant, and which I and my Squire felt to our Coſt but very lately; for Encountring with a terrible Gyant, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I gave him a total overthrow, yet were we ſet upon by two wicked Negroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, who by their curſed Magick Art gave us many terrible Blows, which we were not able to withſtand, and as I conceive the Reaſon is, for that as yet I have not received the Order of Knighthood, my requeſt therefore is, that ſince I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted myſelf to the publick good, I may be kindly entertained in this Caſtle, and that the Lord thereof will dub me Knight, according to the Rules of that Heroick Order of</hi> Knights Errant.</p>
               <p>The good Old Squire hearing Sir <hi>Billy</hi>'s oration, could not chuſe but ſmile, and being one of a pleaſant Diſpoſition, he reſolved to Sooth him up in his Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, thereby to make himſelf and the Gentlemen his Friends the better ſport, therefore fixing his eyes on Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> with a grave Countenance thus ſpake to him</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How highly your noble reſolution is to be commended, I want words for to expreſs, ſure you imitate the Arts of the valiant</hi> Hercules, <hi>whoſe Labours were for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of Tyrants, and righting ſuch perſons as were wronged. Know then, Sir, you are very welcome to our Castle, and for the Order of</hi> Knight-Hood, <hi>we ſhall take ſuch a courſe, that you ſhall not go without it, leſt the World ſhould be deſtitute of thoſe many Succeſſes which are deſtined to your Victorious Arm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words were very pleaſing to Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> but much more to <hi>Ricardo,</hi> who now was in good hopes of recruiting his wambling Belly, which wanted the uſual meſs of Porrege that he uſed to have for his Breakfaſt before he went to plough; therefore alighting off their Horſes, and committing them to the care of one of the Servants, they walked in with the Gentlemen, and were by the Maſter of the Houſe kindly entertained. But it would have made a Horſe break his Bridle with laughter, to ſee how the young <hi>Knight Errant</hi> and his <hi>Squire</hi> were put to their ſhifts in getting off their Armor, which after ſome difficulty they accompliſhed, and were as ſoon Complemented by the Gentlemen there preſent. Sir <hi>Billy</hi> returned them the like Civilities, but with as many abſurdities, as a Citizen at Court, or as a Clown at a Dancing-School.</p>
               <p>After ſome little diſcourſe, the Gentleman of the Houſe invited <hi>Billy</hi> and his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108980:8"/>Squire to take a repaſt of Victuals provided for them, which was Courteouſly accepted by Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> but eſpecially by <hi>Ricardo,</hi> whoſe barking Stomach cryed aloud for a ſupply. The Gentlemen there preſent deſired excuſe to fit down with them, but with great Admiration beheld how the <hi>Knight</hi> and his <hi>Squire</hi> laid about them in this Teeth-Encounter; more Valiant, and far more Fortunate therein, than in the Encounter with the terrible <hi>Scare-Crow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After they had ſufficiently refreſhed themſelves, Sir <hi>Billy</hi>'s Teeth now lying Idle, his Tongue having free liberty to ſpeak, he began his Speech in this wiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is no undertakings whatſoever ſo Honourable and neceſſary to mankind as this of</hi> Knight Errantry; <hi>were it not for them, how would</hi> Gyants <hi>and</hi> Monſters <hi>o're<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come each Country, deſtroying all with Rapine and Violence; It is the Knights-Errant unconquered Arms that delivereth distreſſed</hi> Knights <hi>and</hi> Ladies <hi>from their Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Inchanted</hi> Caſtles; <hi>who overcomes Magicians and Negromancers, putting an end to their Deviliſh Inchantments, but only the undaunted Proweſs of</hi> Knights-Errant. <hi>Did you ever hear of any</hi> Dragons, Griffins, <hi>or</hi> Sagitaries, <hi>ſlain and deſtroyed, but by the invincible Valour and Matchleſs Magnanimity of</hi> Knights Errant? <hi>In brief, they are the Avengers of Injuries, the Righters of Wrongs, the Supporters of the distreſſed, the Defenders of the Peaceable, and quellers of the riotous. The want of theſe Heroick Perſons in this laſt Age, hath been the cauſe of ſo many Villanies that have been committed, none more able nor more willing to ſuppreſs out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, than</hi> Knights-Errant; <hi>To this Honourable Function have I therefore devoted my ſelf, beſeeching you most Mighty Monarch of this Famous</hi> Caſtle, <hi>for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of my intended purpoſes, to beſtow on me the Honour of</hi> Knight-hood, <hi>whereby I may be enabled to perform ſuch ſeats of Arms, that Babes unborn may read with Wonder the Valiant Arts performed by me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Courteous Old Gentleman hearing his Extravagancies, and willing to make ſome paſtime with his folly, as alſo that his Friends might have ſome Jovial Divertiſement, he freely granted him his requeſt in theſe Words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſt noble Youth, in whom appears the early ſparks of Martial Reſolutions, who would ſeek to quench the Flames of Magnanimity which I ſee already enkindled in your Breast; that were to deprive poſterity of the knowledge of your renowned Actions: therefore know your requeſt is granted, you performing thoſe Services which</hi> Knights-Errant <hi>are bound to do; Namely, this Night to watch your Arms, and manfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them against any one that ſhould ſeek to oppoſe ye, thereby ſhewing your ſelf worthy of the Honour to be conferred on ye, and the next day we ſhall Dub ye Knight accordingly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Billy</hi> thanked him very heartily, undertaking the Charge, and performing it moſt Valiantly, as you ſhall hear in the next Chapter.</p>

               <p>NOw had the Curle pated Waggoner of Heaven finiſht his Diurnal courſe, and driven his panting Steeds down to the Weſtern Hill, and Nights black Wings had Maskt up the light in gloomy Darkneſs, when the renowned Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108980:8"/>Sir <hi>Billy</hi> of <hi>Billerecay</hi> having refreſhed his Spirits with the ſprightly Liquor of the ſpreading Vine, undertook according to thoſe Preſidents he had read in Books of <hi>Chevalry,</hi> to watch his Arms for that Night: accordingly they were ſeated in a very convenient place, where if any oppoſition ſhould be offer'd unto him, he might have full liberty to beſtir himſelf; the Gentleman wiſhing him to be very watchful, becauſe the place he ſaid was troubled with Devils and infernal Spirits; which yet notwithſtanding nothing daunted Sir <hi>Billy's</hi> Courage, ſo much was his Heart fraught with invincible Valour, that he dreaded no Danger what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
               <p>Whilſt <hi>Billy</hi> was thus fixt in watching his Armor; to try his-Man-hood, the Maſter of the Houſe, with the other Gentlemen, perſwaded a Groom, a luſty Stout Fellow, to Encounter with him, promiſing, if he overcame him, a good reward for his Pains. The Fellow, willing to ſhow the Gentlemen ſome ſport, undertakes the ſame; but thinking it more pleaſant to overcome without blows, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to do it by Stratagem; and to this purpoſe, there being a Bears skin in the Houſe, he cloathed himſelf therewith, and putting a Vizard on his Face, and carrying on his ſhoulder a lighted Candle in the Rinde of a <hi>Pompion,</hi> cut out with the reſemblance of Noſe, Eyes, and Mouth, it looked moſt dreadfully, but leaſt thoſe ſhould not take the wiſhed Effect, he carried in his hand a good Aſhen Towel to defend himſelf. Being thus Accoutred, in the dead of the Night, when darkneſs had clothed our Hemiſphere, ſave only a faint light which <hi>Cynthia</hi> gave through the dusky Clouds, he Approaches to the place where Sir <hi>Billy</hi> ſtood with his drawn Sword to Encounter any that ſhould oppoſe him. At the firſt ſight thereof he was in ſome little Fear, as having never read in all his Books of Erran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, of ſuch a fearfull Apparition; but his Earneſt deſire of being Dub'd a Knight, made him ſlight all danger; ſo that with his great two-handed Sword, he ſtruck at the Groom with all his might; but Fortune herein was Favourable to him, for the blow lighting on the Pompion Lanthorn, broke it all in pieces, and in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant extinguiſht the Light, which made <hi>Billy</hi> verily believe he had cut the Devils head off: Encouraged wherewith he ſo redoubled his blows, that the Fellow thought he would ſend him to the Devil indeed, imagining the cracking of the Pompion had been the cracking of his Bones; wherefore giving him a fair pair of heels, he haſted from his Clutches as hard as he could drive.</p>
               <p>This Victory thus obtained, Sir <hi>Billy</hi> imagined himſelf no leſs than a Second <hi>Hercules,</hi> reſolving to undergo whatſoever attempt ſhould happen unto him; In the mean time the Gentlemen with all the Rhetorick they could uſe, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading the Groom to make a Second onſet on <hi>Billy,</hi> but fear ſtanding at the Gates of his Eyes, put back all perſwaſions which they could uſe; whereupon, willing to have the Frolick continued, one of the Gentlemen undertook the Adventure; and putting on a Buff Coat, a Helmet on his head, and taking a Sword in his right Hand, and a lighted Torch in the other, he marched directly to Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> who very watchfully attended his coming; And now <hi>Caliope,</hi> thou ſacred Siſter of the Muſes, aſſiſt my Pen in deſcribing this Jeſt Earneſt Combat.</p>
               <l>Aſſiſt my trembling and unable Quill,</l>

               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:108980:9"/>
               <p>This young Gentleman, whom for Diſtinction ſake we will call <hi>Orlande,</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great fury to make a paſs at Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> who ſeeing his bright Sword com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directly towards him, went backwards, but not as the Ram to return with the greater fury, but with the ſame mind as Cowards, who run away from the Battel, only to be kill'd further from their fellows Thus retreated he back un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til at laſt his back touched a Brick Wall, when all on a ſudden remembring the Goddeſs he had devoted himſelf unto, it put freſh Vigor into his Veins, and crying out, <hi>O Beauteous Dulcina aſſiſt thy Servant,</hi> he laid about him with as much Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage as <hi>Alcides</hi> when he encountred with the <hi>Nemaean</hi> Lyon, ſo that the Gentleman, to defend himſelf, was forced to uſe his utmoſt skill, but his Torch being longer than Sir <hi>Billy</hi>'s Sword, he croſt the Fire thwart his Face, which put Sir <hi>Billy</hi> again to the retreat; but it would have made one to ſplit with laughter, to ſee how the Gentleman coming up to Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> and having given him three or Four ſlaps with the flat of his Sword, he would fly back again as it were for fear, whom Sir <hi>Billy</hi> then would eagerly purſue; Thus did they make good their ground for ſeveral times, when at laſt Mr. <hi>Orlando</hi> wearied as well as ſatisfied with the divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ran quite away from Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> whom the Conquerour would not purſue, it being his duty then only to watch his Arms.</p>
               <p>Next Morning no ſooner did <hi>Aurora</hi> begin to diſplay her Golden locks, and the Sun to gild the <hi>Horizon</hi> with his Radiance, but the Gentleman, accompanied with the Maſter of the Houſe, went altogether to viſit Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> and to Congratulate with him for his great manhood in defending his Arms. <hi>Arms</hi> (ſaid Sir <hi>Billy</hi>) <hi>I think I have been Encountred this Night with the Felleſt of the infernal Region; but had they had the ſtrength of</hi> Aſcapart <hi>who could bear a Knight at Arms and his Horſe under his Arm; or the skill of</hi> Proteus <hi>who could Transform himſelf into what Shape be pleaſed; or the cunning of</hi> Ulyſſes <hi>who could free himſelf from the Charms of the Inchanting</hi> Syrens, <hi>yet ſhould I have repell'd them all by the help of this my Sword Roſero.</hi> Then recounted he to them the dangerous fight he had with the burning Bear, whoſe Head he broke all in pieces; as alſo his Encounter with the Knight of the flaming Torch; all which he expreſt very highly to his own proweſs, yet imputing it in a great part to the Succour he received from the beautyful <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina,</hi> the Empreſs of his affections, and to whom all Ladies in the World for beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ought to become her Tributaries.</p>
               <p>They all very much applauded his manhood, and the great happineſs of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy who had ſuch an undaunted Champion to her Servant. And now it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by all hands he was worthy to receive the Honour of Knighthood, which was immediately conferred on him by the Lord of the Caſtle, (for ſo did Sir <hi>Billy</hi> account it to be) in this manner.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Billy</hi> being Armed from Top to Toe ſo well as thoſe uncouth pieces could be patched up, attended on by his Squire <hi>Ricardo,</hi> was brought before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Houſe, who was placed in the Hall, being mounted on a Chair of three aſcents high: Sir <hi>Billy</hi> coming before him was commanded to Kneel, which being done, the Old Gentleman ſtruck him ſuch a blow on the Neck with his Sword, as Sir <hi>Billy</hi> had cauſe to remember his Knighting, and then ſaid to him, <hi>Ariſe thou Victorious Knight at Arms, the Killer of Gyants, and queller of Monſters, the moſt Renowned Sir</hi> Billy <hi>of</hi> Billerecay; <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſeeing ſuch Honour as he thought
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108980:9"/>done to his Maſter, began to applaud his Fortune that ever he became Squire to ſo brave a Knight; and his belly being recruited with better Victuals than ever his teeth were acquainted withall before, he thought himſelf not inferior to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and accordingly demeaned himſelf, which humour of his the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Houſe ſo well followed, that he became no leſs conceited than his Maſter, who now being made Knight, was Company only for thoſe of the better Sort.</p>
               <p>Now to compleat their mirth, it ſo happened that at the ſame time there came two or three Friends to viſit this Gentleman, who ſeeing Sir <hi>Billy</hi> ſtrutting it in Armor, much wondered what the Antick meant, to be ſo clad in a time of general Peace; but being informed by the aged Gentleman of his Extravagant Humours, they were highly taken with the conceit, and reſolved to ſooth him up in his Rediculous Fancies, whereupon one of them Accoaſted him in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſt Magnanimous Knight, whoſe Heroick Actions will hereafter be founded forth by Fames Silver Trumpet; we hearing of your reſolution to revive again the Honour of Chevalry, which too long hath lain neglected in theſe times of Eaſe and Idleneſs, came to congratulate this your Noble intention, which will hereafter Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize your Name with Fame ſo far as</hi> Phoebus <hi>ſhall dart forth his Golden Rays; How happy therefore will that Poet be, whoſe lucky fate ſhall guide him to record your never dying Facts, and thrice happy will that noble Lady be, on whom you ſhall pleaſe to cast your Affection, having ſuch a Champion to Vindicate her Honour, the Sound of whoſe Name carries Victory before him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Billy</hi> ſtood gaping with his Mouth wide open, greedily to ſuck in thoſe praiſes which were beſtowed upon him; <hi>Ricardo</hi> as greedy of Fame as his Maſter, asked the Gentleman, if that Poet, Hiſtorian, or writer, who recorded his Maſters Acts, did not alſo ſet forth the Deeds of Squires Errant? <hi>Billy</hi> laughing at his Squires ſimplicity, told him, that was a needleſs queſtion, ſince the Knights and the Squires actions were as inſeparable as a Fiſh and Water, without the one the other Dyes; Only the Knight was to be praiſed for his valiant Acts, and the Squire for Obedience to his Commands. <hi>But where then</hi> (ſaid <hi>Ricardo</hi>) <hi>is the reward of his Service?</hi> For that, ſaid <hi>Billy,</hi> after the Knight hath finiſhed his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, he commonly makes him the Captain of ſome Caſtle, or Governour of an Iſland, according as he finds his abilities anſwerable thereto. Never queſtion my abilities (ſaid <hi>Ricardo</hi>) in any ſuch things, for he that knows how to govern himſelf, knows how to govern a Family, and he that can govern a Family, need not fear but he can govern an Iſland.</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe betwixt Sir <hi>Billy</hi> and his Squire made the Gentlemen to laugh heartily; who now conſulted together upon what attempt to put this new made Knight, at laſt they agreed to ſet up a <hi>Quinten,</hi> which is a croſs bar turning upon a pole, having a broad board at the one end, and a bag full of Sand hanging at the other; Now he that ran at it with his Launce, if he hit not the board was laughed to Scorn, and if he hit it full and rid not the faſter, would have ſuch a blow with the ſand Bagg on his Back, as would ſometimes beat them off their Horſes</p>
               <p>But this Exerciſe diſlik'd Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> becauſe as he ſaid, it was not comprized in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108980:10"/>the Rules of Knight Errantry, which was to ſuccour diſtreſſed Ladies, to kill Gyants and Monſters, to raze down inchanted Caſtles, and deſtroy Negromancers, to puniſh Tyrants, and to ſuccour the Widows and Fatherleſs; and therefore he refuſed to make one in any thing but what pertained to Knight Errantry; yet with much intreaty he permitted his Squire <hi>Ricardo</hi> to try his Fortune therein; whilſt he, with the Gentleman of the Houſe, and ſome Ladies there preſent, being mounted on a ſeat made for that pupoſe, did there ſit to behold it.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman which encountred Sir <hi>Billy</hi> was the firſt that ran at the <hi>Quinten,</hi> who performed the ſame with great agility, riding with ſuch ſwift ſpeed as if his Horſe ſcorned to touch the Ground, whereby he came off with great applauſe. The next that ran was a Servant of the Houſe, Steward to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who hitting the board too full, e'er he could paſs away, had ſuch a blow with the ſand-bag as almoſt felled him off his Horſe. Next <hi>Ricardo</hi> was perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to take his turn, whoſe Horſe being thought not ſwift enough for ſuch an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, the Gentleman lent him one of his beſt Geldings, on which being mounted in a great Saddle, he began his race, which was ſo ſwift, that <hi>Ricardo</hi> fearing falling, Curbed him with the Bitt, whereat the Horſe fell to Curvetting and Riſing with his ſore Feet; whereupon <hi>Ricardo</hi> threw away his Launce, and held with both his hands on the Pummel of the Saddle; The Horſe being thus freed from his Reins, ran with <hi>Ricardo</hi> on his back all about the Ground, where multitudes of people were aſſembled to behold the Sport, which cauſed ſuch a laughter amongſt them, with loud Clamors and Noyſe, as Cannons make when they diſgorge their Fiery Vomits, or that of <hi>Nilus</hi> precipitated Cataracts, which Deafens all the people that dwell thereabout.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Billy</hi> was exceeding wroth at this diſgrace of his Squire, threatning Revenge on all thoſe who rejoyced at his Misfortune; but the Gentlemen pacified him all they could, telling him it was only the Fortune of War, and though Knights Errant were of themſelves invincible, yet their Squires were not always ſo. That therefore it would be convenient for him to try the adventure himſelf to recover the diſgrace of his Squire; for though ſuccouring diſtreſſed Ladies and Killing of Gyants were the main properties belonging to Knights Errant, yet that they accuſtomed themſelves alſo to Juſts and Turnaments, which were near of kin unto the <hi>Quinten.</hi> That he need not doubt but by the might of his invincible Arms, and the aſſiſtance of the Lady of his Affections, but he ſhould be victorious in whatſoever he went about. Theſe and the like words ſo Encouraged Sir-<hi>Billy,</hi> that he ſwore by the honour of his Knighthood, he would encounter with the <hi>Quinten</hi> although it were the Devil himſelf.</p>
               <p>The Gentlemen having now what they deſired, ſoothed him up, until he was mounted on his <hi>Bellerophon,</hi> for he would ride no other, profeſſing that <hi>Bucephalus</hi> the Horſe of King <hi>Alexander</hi> was not comparable unto him; ſo taking his Launce in his hand, he rid with all his might at the <hi>Quinten,</hi> and hitting the Board a full blow, brought the Sand-Bag about with ſuch Force, as made him meaſure his length on the Ground. This diſgrace of the Maſter, cauſed a louder laughter than that of the Servant, but in Sir <hi>Billy</hi> it wrought ſuch ſhame and Confuſion, as had almoſt baniſht in him all further thoughts of Knight Errantry; wherefore the Gentlemen, to keep up the humour, told him, that this was done by the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108980:10"/>envy of the wicked Negromancer <hi>Soto;</hi> who was an utter Enemy to all Knights Errant. <hi>And might it not be</hi> (ſaid Sir <hi>Billy</hi>) <hi>for want of invocating the help of the Lady of my Affections, the Beautiful</hi> Dulcina? <hi>O yes</hi> (<hi>quoth</hi> Orlando) <hi>that hath often happened to ſeveral other Knights before ye; St.</hi> George <hi>the valiant Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of</hi> England, <hi>for want of invocating the aſſiſtance of his Lady</hi> Sabra, <hi>induced a Seven years Impriſonment in a Dungeon in</hi> Perſia; <hi>the Renowned</hi> Montelion Knight of the Oracle, <hi>never entered into any Combat, but he implored the help of his Lady</hi> Philotheta, <hi>which made him proſper in all his undertakings.</hi> Paladine <hi>of</hi> England <hi>uſed always to crave the Aſſiſtance of his Lady</hi> Nonparelia, <hi>and the Honour of Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry,</hi> Don Beliavis of Greece, <hi>in all his Combats evermore called out upon the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs</hi> Florisbella <hi>Daughter to the Souldan of</hi> Babylon. <hi>Let me therefore adviſe ye, as one Born to Acts of Chevalry, to have always in your remembrance the Laws of Knight Errantry, that neither Magicians, Gyants, Negromancers, nor Monſters, may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ever have any advantage over ye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Billy</hi> upon this, imputing all his ill luck to the want of a due obſervation of the Cuſtoms uſed by former Knights Errant, reſolved to be more careful there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and thinking this Council of <hi>Orlando</hi> to proceed from the Sage <hi>Friſon,</hi> (a Famous Enchanter which he had read of in his Books of Knighthood) he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him many thanks, vowing henceforward to have his Lady <hi>Dulcina</hi> always in his Thoughts, ſhe being the Mirrour of Beauty, Map of Modeſty, and non-parallel of all perfections of her time.</p>
               <p>And now being in this reſolution, and having accompliſhed his Buſineſs in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his receiving the Order of Knighthood, he reſolved to depart from thence to ſeek out adventures, to the great grief of his Squire <hi>Ricardo,</hi> who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his diſgrace in running at the <hi>Quinten,</hi> was loath to depart, having his Belly ſtuffed every day with ſtore of meat, and Bottles of Wine, things unknown in his Fathers Houſe, and knew not well when they ſhould come to ſuch another Caſtle to be ſo well entertained; He therefore conjured by the Honour of his Knighthood, and as he deſired hereafter to Conquer Iſlands, and Inchanted Caſtles, not to depart ſo haſtily, but to remain there until they had participated further of the Lord of the Caſtles bounty.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> whoſe mind ran upon Honour more than upon his belly, to check his Squires Gluttonous Appetite, began to read to him this Lecture of Sobriety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How happy was the Golden Age, when men fed only on Acorns and Nuts, and whoſe Drink was Water from the Criſtal Spring; when thoſe two wrangling Words of</hi> Meum <hi>and</hi> Tuum <hi>were not known in the World, but mens hearts and Houſes were open, and every ones Dwelling was a general rendezvous; when inſtead of Cups and Diſhes, they Drank out of the Palms of their Hands, having not need of Coin nor Golden Oar, for all things were in common to them. Then could not the Weight of a Fee Poize</hi> Juſtice <hi>to which ſide ſhe pleaſed, and Mens Love was pure down-right, not having learn'd the Hipocriſy of Complements. The Hob-nail'd Swain whiſtled not then to his Teem, for the Teeming Ground gave all things freely without Tillage, and Roſes and Flowers produced themſelves without the help of Gardners. The Bees were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to Hives, but freely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108980:11"/>them, and their thoughts were as chaſt as the</hi> Veſtal Nuns. <hi>The Sheep and Lambs fed ſecurely, nor did the Steer or Ox dread the ſlaughtering Butcher. The Silk Worm did not then work to cloath Gallants with Pride, and inſtead of Down-Beds their lodging was on the cold Ground, they needed not Phyſicians, becauſe they knew not what ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs meant, and want of exceſs kept them free from Diſeaſes. Thoſe were rightly termed the Golden Days, not that Gold was then ſo plentiful, but becauſe men had no need of it. The Covetouſneſs of which is the cauſe of all the miſchiefs in the World; Thefts, Rapines, Murthers, Falſe-Swearings, Lying and Deceit, all proceed from the deſire of Gold, as doth Sickneſſes and all manner of Diſeaſes from Gluttony and Exceſs. Rouſe up thy ſelf therefore Friend</hi> Ricardo, <hi>and give not thy Mind to eating and Idleneſs, for Fame calls us alou'd from the Bed of Sluggiſhneſs, and the way to Honour is by Hazardous Attempts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ricardo</hi> regarded not much his Maſters diſcourſe, as one whom no arguments could convince againſt eaſe and eating, but that it was the moſt delightſom Life that Mortals in this World can attain unto; But Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> whoſe mind ran more upon fighting than feeding, would by no means condeſcended to ſtay any longer, wherefore taking his leave of the Lord of the Caſtle (as he termed it) as alſo of the other Gentlemen, who were very well pleaſed with the divertiſements he made them, he and his Squire having buckled on their Armor, and mounted their Steeds, betook themſelves unto their Journey.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 4.</hi> Sir <hi>Billy</hi> being dubbed Knight, Marcheth forth to ſeek Adventurers: His encounter with Poppet-Gyants: His Impriſonment in a wooden Inchanted Caſtle; and Entertainment by the Sage Freſton.</head>
               <p>WHilſt Sir <hi>Billy</hi> and his Squire were thus Acting the Pageant Knight, Old <hi>Thomaſio</hi> who was returned from paying his Landlord his Rent, being in formed of the Departure of his Son, and (what was moſt dear to him) two of his beſt Horſes, he broke forth into ſuch a ſad Lamentation, as would have grieved a Heart of Flint to hear it, Curſing the time that ever he put his Son to School, but more, that ever he bought him any Books of Knight Errantry. Saying, <hi>They were all compoſed of meer witchcraft, and therefore not fit to be ſuffered in a well governed Common-wealth.</hi> And now ſeeing he could not come at his Son, he reſolved to be revenged on his Books; but being ignorant in all ſorts of Learning, he aſſociated to him Sir <hi>John</hi> the Curate of the Pariſh to peruſe them, and whom he condemned for faulty to be caſt into the fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Billy</hi> had locked up all his Library in a very large Cheſt, of which he carried the Key always about him, and therefore Old <hi>Thomaſio</hi> cauſed it to be broke open. The firſt Book they laid hands on, was Sir <hi>Bevis of Southampton; This</hi> (ſaid the Curate) <hi>is the Father of our Engliſh Romancers, made upon a Knight who lived in the time of King</hi> William <hi>the Conqueror, but hath in it an Ell of lying to an Inch of Truth. And by my fay</hi> (ſaid <hi>Thomaſio</hi>) <hi>a Lyar they ſay is as bad as a Thief, and therefore into the Fire he ſhall go, although he were a killer of Gyants and Dragons.</hi> The next that came to hand was the Firſt and Second part of <hi>Amadis de Gauls</hi> in Engliſh: <hi>The Original of this</hi> (ſaid the Curate) <hi>is French, of which there is above thirty Parts, but we in Engliſh have but Six of them. And by Plough Share</hi> (ſaid
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108980:11"/>
                  <hi>Thomaſio</hi>) <hi>that is too much by above five of them, and therefore he ſhall accompany his fellow Sir</hi> Bevis <hi>in the fire. Next</hi> (ſaid the Curate) <hi>here is</hi> Palmerin D'oliva <hi>in three Parts,</hi> Primaleon <hi>of</hi> Greece <hi>in three Parts,</hi> Palmerin <hi>of</hi> England <hi>in three Parts, and</hi> Palmendas <hi>in one, all theſe are one continued Hiſtory of an Emperor of</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>called</hi> Palmerin D'ovila, <hi>his Son</hi> Primaleon, <hi>and Grandſon</hi> Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>and others. By my fay</hi> (ſaid <hi>Thomaſio</hi>) <hi>theſe</hi> Palmerins <hi>and</hi> Amadiſſes <hi>were notable Cutting ond Slaſhing Blades, which made a great diſturbance in the World, but we ſhall reconcile them all in one fire together, notwithſtanding they were ſuch big Fellows in their time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The next</hi> (ſaid the Curate) <hi>is</hi> Don Belianis <hi>of</hi> Greece, <hi>one who could cut two or three Gyants in two by the midle at a ſtroke. Were he</hi> Achilles <hi>of</hi> Greece (ſaid <hi>Thomaſio</hi>) <hi>he ſhould go to the Fire, and if I had the Authour of his Hiſtory he ſhould likewiſe accompany him for his abominable lying. The next</hi> (ſaid the Curate) <hi>is</hi> Paladine of <hi>England, one alſo of French extraction, but more modeſt in his expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than</hi> Don Bellianis: <hi>His Modeſty</hi> (ſaid <hi>Thomaſio</hi>) <hi>ſhall not excuſe him, but he ſhall to the fire, were he as big a Frenchman as</hi> Charlemain. <hi>But what Sir</hi> John <hi>is that Book which hath a Curtain drawn over the Letters in the beginning of it? This</hi> (ſaid the Curate) <hi>is worthy to be preſerved, it being the Hiſtory of</hi> Argalus <hi>and</hi> Parthenia, <hi>written by the divine Poet Mr.</hi> Francis Quarles. Why (ſaid <hi>Thomaſio</hi>) <hi>was not that</hi> Argalus <hi>a Knight-Errant? O no</hi> (quoth the Curate) <hi>but one who was premiſed for the pattern of Vertue, and example of true Love and Magnanimity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words gave the noble <hi>Argalus</hi> a reprieve from the Fire, but the next they laid hands on felt a worſer Fate, which was the <hi>Mirror of Knighthood</hi> in Nine Parts, for which <hi>Thomaſio</hi> would hear no excuſe, but ſaid, that <hi>the fire would purge it from all its lys, wherewith that and other Books of Knight Errantry do abound;</hi> whereupon it was caſt into the Fire; as alſo, the Four Sons of <hi>Amon, Arthur</hi> of great <hi>Brittain, Arthur</hi> of little <hi>Brittain, Valentine</hi> and <hi>Orſon, Pariſmus</hi> and <hi>Pariſmenus, Montelian</hi> Knight of the Oracle, <hi>Ornatus</hi> and <hi>Arteſia,</hi> the Seven Champions of <hi>Chriſtendom, Guy</hi> of <hi>Warwick, Cleoctreon</hi> and <hi>Cloryana, Chinon</hi> of <hi>England, Galien</hi> of <hi>France, Aratos</hi> Prince of <hi>Greece, Tom</hi> a <hi>Lincoln</hi> the Red Roſe Knight, <hi>Huon</hi> of <hi>Burdedux, Pheander</hi> the Maiden Knight, and all other Books of that Nature, of which he would ſpare none; and indeed he had none of the more refined Sort, ſuch as <hi>the Counteſs of Pembrook's Arcadia, Bentevolio and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rania, The Illuſtrous Baſſa, Grand Cyrus, Aſtreo, Palexander, Eremenn, the baniſhed Virgin, Coralbo, Ariana, Clclia, Caſſandra, Cleopatra, Pharamond, Iphigenis, Grand Scipio,</hi> and ſome others; Theſe I conceive either were not written in his time, or too dear for him to purchaſe. Some Books of Poetry he had likewiſe amongſt them; but all <hi>Thomaſio's</hi> ſpight being againſt Knight Erran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he let the Books of Poetry eſcape the Fire, yet judged them not good for any thing, unleſs to be put under Mutton Paſties or Apple-Pies.</p>
               <p>In the mean time while theſe things were acting, Sir <hi>Billy</hi> was purſuing his Knightly Adventures, little thinking what a fiery tryal his Knights Errant were put to at home. And long he thought the time until he might meet with ſome Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture which might Crown his undertakings, being fully perſwaded that now he was made Knight, no power whatſoever could withſtand the force of his Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Arm. In the mean time his Squire was devoutly praying to meet with ſuch
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108980:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>another Caſtle wherein to recruit his wambling belly, which was every five or ſix hours inceſſantly craving for a ſupply. Having thus rid about three or Four Miles, they came to a Market-Town, where at that time was kept a Fair, in the middle whereof was a ſtately Inn, in which was a Poppet-Show to be ſeen, to which purpoſe they had hanged out a painted Cloth, whereon was this written.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Within this place is to be ſeen, the Fight betwixt little</hi> David <hi>and</hi> Goliah <hi>the Gyant of</hi> Gath, <hi>as alſo of other Gyants killed by</hi> David's <hi>Servants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Billy</hi> having read the Writing, and finding that Gyants were within, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to encounter with them; ſo alighting from his Horſe, he gave him to <hi>Ricardo</hi> to walk, whilſt he went to kill the Gyants, and following the multitude, he came to a door where a Woman ſat to take Mony of them who would ſee the Show; <hi>Billy</hi> knowing that Knights Errant were priviledged to paſs any where without Money, refuſed to pay, whereupon he was ſtopped from going in, at which incenſed he drew his Sword, threatning Death to any who ſhould oppoſe him; and ſo without any further oppoſition, ran into the Chamber where the Gyants were placed upon a Table ready to be ſhown: Sir <hi>Billy</hi> no ſooner ſaw them, but quick as lightning he fell upon them with his truſty Sword <hi>Roſero,</hi> making ſuch havock amongſt them, that the Maſter of the Show, like a man di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, ran out crying, <hi>help, help; Murther, Murther;</hi> for his Gyants were kill'd before the fight begun.</p>
               <p>This hideous out-cry preſently raiſed a confuſed rabble, who running in fell upon <hi>Billy,</hi> belabouring him as he had done the Poppets, who yet ſo valiantly behaved himſelf, that twice or thrice he put them to the retreat, when at laſt came the Conſtable attended with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> or eight ruſty Bill-men, who commanded him in the Kings Name to keep the Peace. <hi>Thou wicked Negromancer</hi> (ſaid Sir <hi>Billy</hi>) <hi>I defy thee, and all the Gyants in the World:</hi> And with that fell upon the Conſtable with might and main, dealing ſuch blows as <hi>Hector</hi> when he hew'd down the <hi>Greeks.</hi> But alaſs what can ſingle valour do againſt a multitude, <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> himſelf may be overmacht by number, One of the watchmen coming behind him, Cowardly knock'd him down with his Halbert, and now there lay ſprawling on the Ground our young <hi>Bevis,</hi> our <hi>Amadis, Palmendos,</hi> or what you will pleaſe to call him. In the mean time the people abroad had ſeiz'd on <hi>Ricardo,</hi> demanding of him what mad-man that was he came withal, and for what reaſon they went ſo clad in Armor? <hi>That Magnanimous Hero</hi> (ſaid <hi>Ricardo</hi>) <hi>which you ſaw, is the Victorious Knight at Arms, Sir</hi> Billy <hi>of</hi> Billerecay, <hi>and I his Squire</hi> Don Ricardo, <hi>Born to be the Governour of an Iſland when my Maſter can conquer it; the reaſon why we go in Armor is, becauſe it is the Cuſtom of Knight Errants, and Squire Errants, ſo to do.</hi> Theſe words made the people to think they were a couple of mad-men, and therefore ſecuring their Horſes, they put both the Knight and his Squire in the Cage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Billy</hi> incloſed in this wooden Tenement, began to rage exceedingly: <hi>Vile miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>the off-ſpring of Vipers and Poyſonous Toads, Enemies to Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, and Foes to true Chevalry; think not although by your damned ſpells you have Captivated my Body, yet I queſtion not but by the help of the Sage</hi> Freſton <hi>I ſhall

               <p>Theſe his raging words made the Boys to hoot at him, whilſt <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſat ſighing to ſee his hopes of an Iſland come to a Cage, which yet his Maſter would needs perſwade him was done by Inchantment: <hi>Have you not read</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>how the ſeven Champions of</hi> Chriſtendom <hi>having killed the Gyants which belonged to</hi> Leoger <hi>the Knight of the black Caſtle, yet by a Magician they were caſt upon a Bed, from whence they could not ſtir until they were delivered by St.</hi> Georges <hi>three Sons. But ſaid</hi> Ricardo, <hi>I cannot Imagine that he was a Magician that put us into this Cage, but ſuch another man of Office as we have at</hi> Billerecay, <hi>which they call a Conſtable, becauſe he had in his hand a painted Staff, which ſhewed him to be a Man in Authority. That</hi> (ſaid <hi>Billy</hi>) <hi>proceeds from your Ignorance, not knowing that a Magician can transform himſelf into what ſhape he pleaſes; does not the Devil ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times take upon him the likeneſs of a Broker, ſometimes of a Horſe Courſer, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of a Bum-Bayliff, under which Shapes he acts ſo many Roguries, for no Man of himſelf can do ſuch wickedneſſes, but only the Devil that aſſumes their Shapes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt the Knight and his Squire were thus diſcourſing, the Conſtable came to fetch them before a Juſtice, at which news <hi>Ricardo</hi> wept bitterly; but <hi>Billy</hi> was ſo firm in his determination that you might as ſoon have removed the Earth from its Center, or ſtopped the Sun in his diurnal Courſe, as to have cauſed him to alter his mind, or think that thoſe Books of Knight Errantry, were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted verity, and as true as the voice of <hi>Jove</hi> it ſelf. The Juſtice, though grave and ſolid in his office, yet was one who much delighted in mirth and harmleſs Sport, who being informed of all what had paſs'd, much admired at the ones boundleſs extravagancy, and the others harmleſs ſimplicity. The Maſter of the Show made a grievous complaint againſt him of the wrong he had ſuſtained; <hi>Never</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>after a Battel did you behold the diſmembred Limbs of ſlaughtered Carcaſes lie ſo Scattered about as in this Skirmiſh; here lay an Arm, there a Leg, eſpecially my Gyant</hi> Goliah <hi>was ſo bemangled, that his ruinated Carcaſe was not fit for a Scare-Crow.</hi> At that word <hi>Scare-Crow, Ricardo</hi> ſtepping forth ſaid, <hi>My Maſter never has ſo ill Fortune as when he encounters with Scare-Crow</hi> Gyants. And thereupon told the Juſtice of the blows they had received by encountring with the Scare-Crow Gyant, as is related in the Second Chapter.</p>
               <p>The Juſtice was ſo highly pleaſed with this diſcourſe, that he reſolved with himſelf to further the humor; and ſo giving the Maſter of the Show ten pound for damage, he diſcharged the Conſtable of him, and invited the Knight and his Squire home to his Houſe, where he feaſted them Royally, which made <hi>Ricardo</hi> begin afreſh to have a good opinion of Knight Errantry, for feeding was more agreeable to his Nature by far than Fighting. And now Sir <hi>Billy</hi> began a little to be more reconciled to reaſon, and to diſcourſe without rageing, whereupon the Juſtice deſired him to honour him ſo much as to give him an account of his forepaſſed Life, that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108980:13"/>by that means poſterity might be informed of his Heroick Acts, and by reading his Life leave an Example for poſterity to imitate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir</hi> (ſaid <hi>Billy</hi>) <hi>Courteſy is one of the vertues inherent to Knight Errantry, and I having received ſo many Favours from you for my ſelf and my Squire, cannot in gratitude do leſs, than to give you an impartial account of what you deſire, which yet howſoever is but only the beginning of what I intend ſhall be performed by my Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Arm.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Know then</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>moſt worthy Governour of this Famous City, that the place which will be for ever Honoured by my Birth, is the Town of</hi> Billerecay <hi>in the County of</hi> Eſſex; <hi>my Parents happy in producing a Son of ſuch Magnanimity as the Gods have endued me with, to be the preſerver of Innocence, and avenger of wrongs. in my blooming youth it was my Fortune as other Knights Errant have been, to be Captivated by the beautyfull looks of the fair</hi> Dulcina, <hi>the Mine, the Magazine, the Common-Wealth of Beauty; one upon whom Nature and curious Art have done their beſt to ſum that rare perfection which tranſcends the power of belief. For the Love of this peerleſs Parragon, this Phaenix of perfection, have I took upon me this order of Knight Errantry, not doubting but by my Victorious Arm, to make her Name as Famous as was that of</hi> Cloryana <hi>the beloved Miſtreſs of the renowned Knight</hi> Cleocreton <hi>Prince of</hi> Hungary.</p>
               <p>The Juſtice commended him highly for his reſolution: <hi>But</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>moſt valiant Knight, I wonder that in all this time you do not acquaint the divine Lady of your Affections with your proceedings, who no doubt muſt needs think long to hear of your Atchievements; Beſides, it was always the Cuſtom of Knights Errant to imploy their Squires on ſuch Embaſſies, therefore you having ſuch a peerleſs</hi> Non-parelia <hi>to your Lady, cannot in Civility to her omit ſuch a thing.</hi>
               </p>

And thereupon borrowing Pen Ink and paper of the Juſtice, becauſe Knights Errant never carry any thing about them, but only Mouths to Eat, and Swords to fight, he writ to her in theſe Words.</p>

               <p>Having finiſhed his Letter, he ſhewed it to the Juſtice, whom with Sir <hi>Billy</hi> we muſt now call the Sage <hi>Freſton;</hi> who applauded it exceedingly, as the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt piece of ingenuity that Art ever contrived; telling him, that that Ladies heart muſt be more obdurate than Marble whom ſuch language could not molify. <hi>Billy</hi> was mightily pleaſed with his expreſſions, and calling his Squire <hi>Ricardo</hi> unto him, he thus expreſt himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My truſty Squire, I muſt now imploy thee upon a weighty affair, which I am the more willing to do, knowing thy abilities anſwerable to thy good intentions, hereupon I have deputed thee my</hi> Ambaſſador, Nuncio, <hi>or</hi> Meſſenger, <hi>to deliver this Letter into the hands of that abſtract of true Beauty, whoſe radient look ſtrikes every gazing eye ſtark blind, and keeps the amazed beholder under the ſtupid tyranny of Love and wonder; I mean the Beautyful</hi> Dulcina, <hi>the Miſtreſs of my Affections, and Sole Commandreſs of my undertakings; and ſee thou do it in a garb and poſture worthy the Servant of ſo illuſtrious a Knight, that afterwards it may be Inroled by him that ſhall Write my Hiſtory with Commendations to thy Eternal Fame.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ricardo</hi> was much ſurpriz'd at his Maſters ſuperabundant Rhetorick; but loath to loſe a place of ſo good entertainment, where inſtead of fighting was full feeding, and no gaſhing nor ſlaſhing but only of Loins of Beef, Shoulders of Mutton, and good fat Capons, all which ſuited extraordinary well with his Stomach; But what moſt of all troubled him, was, that he was to go he knew not whether, to deliver a meſſage to he knew not who; and therefore grumbling told his Maſter, <hi>that he Commanded him impoſſibilities, to find out a Lady of which there was none ſuch but only in Imagination.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. 5. Ricardo</hi> is ſent with a Letter to <hi>Dulcina,</hi> in the mean time Sir <hi>Billy</hi> encountreth with a monstrous Gyant in defence of the <hi>Tantabilan</hi> Princeſs, whom he Manfully overthrows.</head>
               <p>NExt Morning no ſooner had <hi>Aurora</hi> aroſe from Aged <hi>Tithonas</hi> Bed, and ſcattered the light from off her Saffron Wheeles, but the nimble Knight, <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſhaking off ſleep from thoſe ſilken Fumes that do bind the Senſes, aroſe from his Bed, and having taken a luſty Breakfaſt, he then told his Maſter he was ready to perform his Commandment in delivering his Letter to the fair hands of his beautiful Lady <hi>Dulcina,</hi> alias <hi>Joan Grumball;</hi> and queſtion not but to bring you an Anſwer according to your deſires; Nor ſhall I arrogate any of the Honour of your Atchievements to my ſelf, though in many of the Encounters I bore equal
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108980:14"/>blows with you, but whatſoever is due to your praiſe therefore, it ſhall be wholly and ſolely yours.</p>
               <p>Had not Sir <hi>Billy's</hi> mind been wholly taken up on thoughts of Knight Errantry, he might eaſily have perceived how groſly his Squire had abus'd him; but he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puring it all to duty, and reſpect which he bore to his Valour, was contented with praiſe though never ſo rediculous. And therefore delivering him the Letter, with many Commendations reiterated to the Miſtreſs of his Affections, he took his leave of him, who mounting on <hi>Pugnoto,</hi> his truſty Steed, leaving his Armor behind him to the care of his Maſter, who promiſed to ſtay till his return, he took his Journey towards <hi>Billerecay,</hi> where weleave him for a time, the whilſt our Pen ſhall wait upon his Maſter.</p>
               <p>The Juſtices Servants minding to put a trick upon this our Knight Errant, dreſſed up the Foot-Boy in Womans Apparel, adorning him with Rings, Bracelets, and other Jewels; ſo that he ſeemed to be a compleat Princeſs, which part he was to act, attended on by two youths who went to School in the Town, and were to perſonate her Brothers. Theſe being accoutred in this manner, were by the Steward of the Houſe conducted to Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> who was walking in a Garden, Contemplating of the perfections of his <hi>Dulcina;</hi> Being come before his Princeſs <hi>Nicoſia</hi> (for ſo was ſhe called) kneeling upon her knees thus ſpake to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſt Renowned Knight, whoſe Valiant Acts the World both admires and dread, who were't born for the comfort of all in diſtreſs, and for the Terror and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment of preſuptuous Offenders. If ever pitty, that poor comfort of Calamity, creep into your Heart, I beſeech you take Compaſſion of a diſtreſſed Princeſs whom unjuſt Tyranny hath baniſh't from my Native Habitation.</hi> Having proceeded ſo far, Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> who was as courteous as he was valiant, would not permit her any longer to kneel, but raiſing her from the ground, he ſaid, <hi>Moſt peerleſs Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, although my Honour of Knighthood might claim ſuch obſervance at your hands, yet know that Courteſie Harbours in Heroick Breaſts, who are readier to give Benefits than to receive Thanks; let me therefore know your requeſts, wherein you have been wronged, and queſtion not but by the help of my Victorious Arm you ſhall be righted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>my native Country is</hi> Tantabilus, <hi>my Father the unhappy Prince thereof, uhhappy in having ſuch a Daughter, whoſe Beauty and Breeding might have been a comfort unto him, although it proved the cauſe of his undoing; for Fame hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (how worthily I know not) blazed abroad my perfections thorough divers Countries, it came at laſt to the ears of a great Magician named</hi> Diabolo, <hi>the Lord of an Inchanted Caſtle, ſtanding on the Confines of</hi> Arduro, <hi>from whence he ſent a Letter to my Father, deſiring to have me in marriage, which if he refuſed, he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to take me by force, and in ſtead of a Wife to make me his Concubine. This Meſſage was ill reſented by my Father, but much more by me who was to be his</hi> alter idem, <hi>or ſecond ſelf; for when I underſtood what he deſired, or rather to ſay more truer, what he demanded; I brake forth into ſuch a violent paſſion as poſſeſt the Mad</hi> Oreſtes <hi>when he was diſtraught his Wits, who had ſeen the Picture of</hi> Alecto, <hi>or with what manner of countenance</hi> Medea <hi>killed her own Children, needed but take my Face for the full ſatisfaction of his knowledge in that point; vowing rather to be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108980:14"/>buried in a Grave, than Bedded with ſuch a loathſom perſon. My father ſeeing me in ſuch a deep Paſſion, comforted me all he could, vowing to lay his Crown at ſtake, and venture both his Life and Kingdom, e'er he ſhould obtain me at his hands; and ſo ſending away the Meſſenger with a flat denial, he returned again to his Maſter, who full fraught with Indignation to have his ſuit rejected, threatned revenge in the higheſt manner that could be inflicted. And to that purpoſe raiſed what forces he could, and having ſtore of Money, hired to his aid a mighty Gyant, of whom, our People were ſo afraid, that they fled before his Face like trembling Doves before the ſwooping Eagle, or the timerous Hare from the purſuing Grey-Hound. So that in fine he drove him quite out of his Kingdom, into the Land of</hi> Lycaon, <hi>whether he ſent him a Meſſenger, that if in two Months time he could provide him a Champion that would fight with his Gyant, if he overcame him, he would reſtore his Kingdom again unto him, but if the Gyant overcame his Champion, then ſhould I be at his will and diſpoſal. Now moſt worthy Knight, hearing the Fame of your memorable Adventures, and how you have vowed your ſelf to the Honour of Chevalry; my Father ſent me his diſtreſſed Daughter, accompanied with theſe my ſorrowfull Brothers, to crave your aid againſt this cruel Gyant, not doubting but of your accuſtomed goodneſs as former Knights Errant have uſed to do, you will Succour diſtreſſed Innocence, and quell the pride of this daring Gyant, which will be for your eternal Fame, and memorize your name with Honour to all poſterity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Billy</hi> gave great attention to this diſcourſe, and as if the wrongs of the <hi>Tantabilan</hi> Princeſs had infuſed freſh vigour into his breaſt, he ſwore by the Truncheon of <hi>Mars,</hi> that the Gyant had not long to live; but then he began to think with himſelf whether he ſhould perform this adventure before the return of his Squire; to which the Juſtice under the name of the Sage <hi>Freſton,</hi> told him, that he ſhould not neglect ſuch an opportunity wherein his own honour, with that of the Princeſſes preſervation were ſo highly concerned. That the two Months time wherein the combat was to be performed ran on a-pace, and that if he ſhould meet with any diſaſter in the performance thereof, he would be aiding and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him as he was in his deliverance from the inchanted wooden priſon. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Sir <hi>Billy</hi> animated with theſe perſwaſions, reſolved to ſet upon the Gyant the next day.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe things were Acting, ſome other of the Servants had faſhioned the repreſentation of a Gyant, of a monſtrous bulk, but more monſtrous countenance, ſo that his very looks were able to daunt any one, but he who had ſuch an invincible Courage as Sir <hi>Billy.</hi> This Gyant was armed with a Pole-Axe anſwerable to his Stature, and ſo framed, that one behind him could make him to move his weapon, ſhake his head, and any other Action of his Body as if he were alive; then for ſpeech, a hallow Trunk through his Head into his Mouth, delivered what they would ſpeak by him. Before him they had digged a pit, covered with a Trap-Door, on which whoſoever trod was ſure to fall therein.</p>
               <p>The next morning, to make Sir <hi>Billy</hi> the more hearty to fight, there was made for him a quart of rich Caudle, which was carried up to his Bed-ſide by the Sage <hi>Freſton's</hi> Daughter, a Gentlewoman of an incomparable Beauty, which might have tempted any perſon, unleſs ſuch a one whoſe heart was Gloyſter'd in Ice, but Knights Errant are always chaſt as well as valiant, and her perfections
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108980:15"/>wrought in him no greater Flame than the Glow-Worm ſhoots at the cold breaſt of Night.</p>
               <p>Soon after this refection he roſe from his Bed, when meeting in the Hall the Sage <hi>Freston,</hi> he demanded of him what Damoſel it was that in the ſhape of an Angel appeared to him that Morning, and whether there were any ſhe Angels or no? for this (ſaid he) could not be an illuſion, becauſe I feel by my Stomack the comfortable effects thereof. The Sage <hi>Preſton</hi> told him it was the Damoſel <hi>Muriell,</hi> ſent by the wiſe <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rganda</hi> Lady of the <hi>Fortunate Cave,</hi> who was always a great help to Knights that undertook the defence of diſtreſſed Ladies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Billy</hi> then called for his Armor, ſaying, he would not turn his head until he had confronted the Gyant, deſiring the Sage <hi>Freſton</hi> to go along with him to be a witneſs of his Valour, to which he willingly condeſcended, ſaying, he would not only attend him himſelf, but alſo that his Servants ſhould go along with them; ſo mounting their Horſes they rode about the ſpace of half a Mile, when (as it was concluded on amongſt them before) one came riding towards them as ſwift as the nimble Hind or skipping Roe trips it on the Flowry Lawns, who brought them word that the Gyant in perſuit of the <hi>Tantabilan</hi> Princeſs, was come within a quarter of a Mile of that place, where he ſtayed for the coming of any Champion that ſhould oppoſe him in defence of the Lady, as alſo that he was reſolved to try the Combat on Foot, and therefore deſired that his Enemy would do the ſame.</p>
               <p>No (ſaid <hi>Billy</hi>) never ſhall it be ſaid that I owe any part of my Victory to advantage, for had he the ſtrength of <hi>Hercules</hi> who conquered all that ever he fought withal, or two ſuch Gyants joyn'd together, yet would I not fear to encounter with them both, ſince it was never known that a Gyant did kill a Knight Errant, but always the Knight did beat the Gyant.</p>
               <p>With ſuch manner of diſcourſe they came to the place were the Mock-Gyant was, Then Sir <hi>Billy</hi> alighting from his Horſe gave him to one of the Servants to hold, and drawing his Sword, marched directly towards the Gyant, but before he came to the place were the Trap Door was laid, the Fellow that was placed behind the Gyant thorough his Trunk, delivered theſe words unto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For bear proud Knight to advance any further, unleſs it be upon thy Knees to beg pardon for thy Life; for if thou doest (mark what I ſay) I ſhall cut off thy head, and fix it on a pole to ſcare Birds, thy Body will I ſlice into thin pieces for Cooks to make Pies withall to cheat their hungry Customers; thy Arms and legs will I throw into the fields to be devoured by Ravens and Vulters; and thy Guts and Garbage to the Swine, to fill therewith their hungry Paunches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Sir <hi>Billy</hi> nothing daunted at thoſe proud ſpeeches, kept on ſtill his pace, until he came upon the trap door, which giving up, down he ſlipt into the pit, all the way as he was falling, calling upon the Sage <hi>Freſton</hi> for help. The Servants ſeeing him fall, gave a ſhout like to the roar of a whole Herd of Lyons, or ſuch as the Artillery of Heaven diſcharged along the cleaving sky, and running with haſty ſteps to the place, one more forwarder than the reſt was caught in his own device, and ſlipped in after Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> who louder than he ſhouted before, cryed out for <hi>help, help,</hi> Sir <hi>Billy</hi> was no ſooner down but he recovered his legs, and hearing the other come thundering after him, he imagined it verily to be the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108980:15"/>Gyant, who all the while Sir <hi>Billy</hi> was belabouring him, cryed out with might and main, <hi>Murther, Murther.</hi> The old Juſtice hearing this out cry, cauſed the Trap-Door to be removed, when by the light Sir <hi>Billy</hi> could ſee his adverſary at his feet, to whom he ſaid; <hi>yield thy ſelf vile Miſcreant, and acknowledge the wrong thou haſt done to the</hi> Tantabilan <hi>Princeſs, and I will ſave thy Life, elſe look to be ſerved in the ſame manner thou threatneſt to uſe me, for most just it is to render to every one according to his deſervings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Juſtice hearing the danger his man was in, called to Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> deſiring him to hold his hand, and he would engage for the Gyant; and knowing delay dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, he let down a rope into the pit, deſiring Sir <hi>Billy</hi> to take hold of it that they might draw him up, and let the Gyant remain there, and ſtarve and rot in the Dungeon.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Billy</hi> willingly embraced the proffer, as accounting the Gyant quite vaniſhed, and ſo taking hold of the rope was drawn up, to his double Joy, one of having conquered the Gyant, and the other for his deliverance from that dark Dungeon. The Sage <hi>Freſton</hi> congratulated his Victory with great expreſſions of Joy, whilſt in the mean time the Servants had conveyed the mock Gyant away. But moſt of all the <hi>Tantabilan</hi> Princeſs extolled his valour unto the skies, ſaying, what he had done in her defence, was far beyond what ever was performed by <hi>Amadis de Gaule, Huon of Bourdeaux, Palmerin of England, Falmerin de Oliva,</hi> or <hi>Don Belianis of Greece,</hi> or any other Knight Errant whatſoever, who had fought in deſence of wronged Ladies. Sir <hi>Billy</hi> tickled with theſe praiſes ſtrutted like a Crow in a Gutter, ſaying, <hi>Moſt excellent Princeſs, what ever hath been performed by my valour, comes infinitely far ſhort of your deſervings; and as for your Enemy the Magician</hi> Diabolo, <hi>if he refuſe to ſurrender the Crown again to your Father, let me but know of it, and I ſhall take ſuch ſharp revenge on him and his, that</hi> Tygers, <hi>and</hi> Panthers, <hi>ſhall be accounted merciful in reſpect of the Cruelty I will ſhew upon them.</hi>

               <p>All their diſcourſe tending thus highly to the applauding of Sir <hi>Billy</hi>'s Valour, they mounted their Horſes to return to the Sage <hi>Freſton</hi>'s, all the way they rid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſounding forth but <hi>Panegyricks</hi> of <hi>Billy</hi>'s praiſe, which were ſo welcome to him, that who ſo viewed his looks, might perceive thereby how inwardly his heart was contented.

                  <hi>CHAP. 6.</hi> How <hi>Ricardo</hi> in his Journey towards <hi>Billerecay</hi> met with an Aged Palmer, who gave him an inviſible Ring, with which he cheats an Inn-keeper; as alſo what a Trick he ſerved a Bedlam and a Tinken.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>RIcardo</hi> as you heard in the former Chapter, being ſent on an arrand to the Lady <hi>Dulcina,</hi> bethought himſelf by the way, that if he returned back to <hi>Billerecay,</hi> old <hi>Thomaſio</hi> would apprehend him for ſtealing of his Horſe, and therefore began to doubt whether Squire Errantry would protect him from the Gallows. To prevent which diſgrace, he reſolved upon the firſt opportunity to ſell his Horſe, and with the Mony to maintain himſelf until he could get into a more ſafer Service than that of Knight Errantry. Wandring therefore through by-paths as his moſt ready way, at ſuch time as the days bright burning eye caſt ſcorching Rayes upon the parched Earth, he ſat him down under the Covert of a broad ſpreading Oak, and being full of thoughts not knowing what to do, he ſpyed coming towards him an aged Palmer, one who ſeemed by the downfall of his mellow years, that Nature had brought him near to the door of Death. This Palmer whoſe cold Age had Froſted his gray Hairs, ſaid to him, <hi>Ricardo</hi> Eſquire to the Famous Knight Errant Sir <hi>Billy</hi> of <hi>Billerecay,</hi> I am ſent to thee from the <hi>Goddeſs of Fortune,</hi> with the <hi>Inviſible Ring,</hi> made by the Famous Negromancer <hi>Trebia,</hi> whereby thou ſhalt perform to thy Maſter ſuch Services as ſhall exceed all thoſe which were ever done by any Squire to the beſt Knight Errant that ever wore Sword.</p>
               <p>Then did he inſtruct <hi>Ricardo</hi> in the uſe of the Ring, how putting it on his Finger he could be ſeen by no-body, but as ſoon as it was off he appeared as viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as any other, by which he might both pleaſe and pleaſure himſelf in divers Feaſts. It happened at the ſame time ſome Maids going by to milk their Cows, <hi>Ricardo</hi> to try the vertue of his Ring, putting it on his finger, fell to kiſſing the Maids, which put them to the ſqueak, feeling his Mouth but ſeeing no body.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108980:16"/>
                  <hi>Ricardo</hi> was ſo far tranſported with loy of this Ring, that he could ſcarcely believe ſo great a truth, not daring to truſt his own Eyes, but fearing it to be only ſome flattering Dream or vain Viſion; yet by one inferable Argument he ſound himſelf to be awake, which was, that he was thoroughly an hungry. In the mean time the old Palmer was vaniſhed away; wherefore <hi>Ricardo</hi> reſolved, the firſt thing he did to ſeek out for Belly-Timber, putting his Ring in his pocket, that at a convenient time it might ſerve to diſcharge his reckoning.</p>
               <p>He had not gone long in his way before he came to a ſtately Inn, where alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he commanded the Hoſtler to look well to his Horſe, and give him as many Oats as he would eat; and walking into the Houſe, with as much ſtate as if he had been a Man of ſome ſpecial Note, he called for a Room and a pint of Canary, with both which he was quickly accommodated. Then asked he what proviſion they had in the Houſe? with the beſt of which taking a ſmall repaſt, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a Capon to be laid to the Fire for his better Accommodation; during the time while it was Roaſting, the Hoſt and be drank two or three Pints of Sack. The Capon being ready he fell to it with an extraordinary Stomach, and with as quick a diſpatch waſhed it down with the brisk Canary. But now the main matter of all, the Reckoning came to pay, which for his Horſe and himſelf amounted to ſeven Shillings. <hi>Ricardo</hi> putting his hand into his Pocket as if to draw out his Mony, ſlipped on his Ring, whereby in an inſtant he became inviſible. This ſudden flight of their Gueſt, with the loſs of their Reckoning, put them all into ſuch amaze, that they ſtood ſenſeleſs transformed with Wonder. <hi>Ricardo</hi> in the mean time ſlipped into the Stable, and getting out his Horſe, mounted him, Galloped away as faſt as he could. This made the Hoſtler to Swear like a Culter, that the Horſe ſhould untye himſelf, and run away with the Saddle on his back, for they could ſee no Man that rode thereon. And now both Hoſt, Hoſteſs, and Hoſtler, concluded it was no other than the Devil, who had come thither in the likeneſs of a Gueſt, to puniſh her for falſe ſcoreing with a crotched Chalk, and the Hoſtler for Tallowing of Horſes Teeth, and Cheating them of their Oats by a half peck with a falſe bottom.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Ricardo</hi> was gotten quite out of danger, Hugging himſelf in conceit for the Trick he had ſerved the Inn-keeper, and now he fears no Colours, knowing his Ring a ſure preſervative againſt all dangers; But becauſe his Horſe was not ſo inviſible as himſelf, he reſolved to leave him behind, and to that purpoſe bargained with a Farmer for a Weeks keeping, at the end of which he promiſed to come again and pay him. Then taking his Journy towards <hi>Billere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay,</hi> fearleſs of Stocks, Priſon, or Gallows, on the way he overtook a Bedlam and Tinker, who had newly been taking a luſty cup of <hi>Rum-booz</hi> at the <hi>Bowzing-ken.</hi> With theſe <hi>Ricardo</hi> willingly conſorted, minding to make ſome further experiments with his Ring; ſo asking them where the beſt Liquor was to be had, as men very well knowing that way, they ſoon returned him this pleaſing anſwer. <hi>Maſter, if you will give us half a dozen, we will help you to ſuch nappy Liquor whoſe dancing ſprightly bubbles defie degenerous Fears, and raiſe up poor afflicted Hearts to the higheſt degree of Mirth and Jollity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ricardo</hi> willingly embraced the motion, and ſo joyning Company, they ſtruck down a by-path until they came unto a Woods ſide, by which ſtood a thatch'd
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108980:17"/>Cottage with Loam walls and a Clay Chimney, and though it had no ſign without, it had that within which a ſign ſignified, <hi>Viz.</hi> Beer which would make a Cat ſpeak, and ſuch tranſcendant Ale, that <hi>York, Cheſter, Hull, Nottingham, Darby,</hi> nor <hi>Graveſend</hi> with a Toaſt, could Parallel it. Here did they ſit and tipple <hi>Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum,</hi> until ſuch time as they all grew <hi>Boozy; Ricardo</hi> promiſing to pay for all, thinking when the Reckoning came to pay to eſcape away with his inviſible Ring; But his Fortune had like to have proved very bad, for in ſtriving to ſuddle the other two, he got ſo drunk himſelf that he fell faſt aſleep, as alſo did the other two. In this Swiniſh condition they lay Snoreing four or five hours, at laſt the Tinker awak'd, and ſeeing his two Comrades faſt, and remembring the Golden promiſes <hi>Ricardo</hi> had made, he thought to rifle the Neſt before the Birds were ſlown; and diveing into his Pockets, he found nothing there, but only the Ring, and a knife and ſheaf, which Ring he thought to have been as brazen as his Kettles, and therefore was about to throw it away, and with the knife to have Cut his Throat for cheating him of his Golden Expectation; Howſoever the Ring he put on his Finger, when inſtantly the Hoſteſs came in to look after her Gueſts, but not ſeeing the Tinker, who by wearing the Ring was become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, ſhe fell to Jogging the other two to know what was become of the Tinker? the Tinker Judged her to be mad to ask for him before his Face, and therefore ſaid, <hi>what a P— is the Old Jade blind ſhe cannot ſee me?</hi> The Old Woman hearing his voice, but ſeeing no Body, asked, <hi>where are ye, where are ye?</hi> with that he gave her ſuch a Box on the Ear, as tumbled her down upon <hi>Ricardo,</hi> whoſe fall awaked him out of his ſleep, and hearing the Tinker to Curſe and Bann becauſe his Hoſteſs could not ſee him, he thought he had gotten away his Ring, and feeling in his Pocket found it ſo indeed, wherefore he was ready to ſwound away with fear, but recollecting himſelf he called to the Tinker, ſaying, <hi>Honeſt Brother give me thy Hand,</hi> which the Tinker doing, he nimbly ſlipt the Ring from off his Finger, and as nimbly put it on his own, whereby the Tinker again became viſible, but <hi>Ricardo</hi> was no where to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>The Hoſteſs ſeeing ſuch Juggling tricks, began to call out for her Money, with ſuch a loud voice as waked alſo the Bedlam, who asking for his Maſter, I think (ſaid ſhe) your Maſter is the Devil, for the Tinker and he, are in Dock out Nettle, ſometimes ſeen and ſometimes not, and here is Seven Shillings and ſix pence to pay, and now the Young Devil is fled, which I much marvel at, for I think none of you both have any Croſſes about ye to ſcare him away.</p>
               <p>Whilſt they were thus arguing the caſe, <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſlipt away from them, taking his courſe directly towards <hi>Billerecay,</hi> where how he ſped we ſhall declare in the next Chapter.</p>

               <p>IT was at ſuch time of the day when the Curl pate Waggoner of Heaven had well near finiſht his Diurnal Courſe, and was driving his panting Steeds down towards the Weſtern Hill, when the Renowned Squire Errant <hi>Ricardo</hi> entred into the Town of <hi>Billerecay,</hi> bending his courſe directly towards the Houſe of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108980:17"/>
                  <hi>Jone Grumball,</hi> to whom he delivered Sir <hi>Billy's</hi> Letter, with much obſequiouſneſs, telling her ſuch Stories of his Maſter's Valour, his Honour of Knight-Hood, and of the great affection he bore to her, that her heart began to melt towards him, even as a pound of Butter melts before the Sun. But being ſhe could not read her ſelf, ſhe ſent for a Journey-man Shoomaker to the further end of the Town to read it, one who bore good will unto her, and was at that preſent inditing a Letter to make her know the affection he bore her; <hi>Criſpin</hi> having read it over, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding he had a Knight to his Rival, was very much troubled, but <hi>Jone Grumball</hi> was ſo well pleaſed with the Sugar-Candy Words he ſent unto her, that ſhe vowed her ſelf unto him both Body and Breeches, asking <hi>Ricardo</hi> many queſtions concerning him; all which he anſwered in ſuch lofty Language, ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his proweſs, the reſpects all people ſhewed unto him, with the faithful Love he bare unto her, that ſhe was more and more entangled in the Lime-Twigs of Love, vowing and proteſting her ſelf his for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Criſpin</hi> by theſe preſages finding his Suit like to have but a cold reception, to avenge himſelf on <hi>Ricardo,</hi> by whoſe ſpeeches he thought <hi>Jone</hi>'s Heart was eſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him, he therefore ran to old <hi>Thomaſio,</hi> telling him his Son's partner in ſtealing away his Horſes, was at that inſtant at <hi>Jone Grumball</hi>'s, whom he might eaſily take, and by that means know what was become of his Son, as alſo of his Horſes.</p>
               <p>

                     </gap>,</hi> and ſeizing upon <hi>Ricardo,</hi> threatned him with all the puniſhments he could reckon up, as Hanging, Burning, Drowning, Killing, Stabbing, and twenty other kinds of Death beſides, if he told him not where his Son and Horſes were. <hi>Ricardo</hi> nothing daunted at his Domineering, but intending to put a trick upon him, told him that his Son was become one of the greateſt Lord in the World, that Kings and Queens craved his Aſſiſtance, and Lords and Ladies implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his help; that he commonly kill'd half a dozen Gyants for his Breakfaſt, and bathed his Sword in the Blood of Monſters and Dragons every day; That his Maſter was at that preſent in the Sage <hi>Freſton</hi>'s Caſtle, where the moſt excellent Princeſs <hi>Tantabilus</hi> courted his Love, but that he had vowed himſelf only to the Service of his Beautiful <hi>Dulcina;</hi> In ſum, that his Maſter was a Knight, and he was his Squire, and that therefore by the Laws of Knight Errantry, they were not to be troubled nor moleſted whereſoever they came.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Thomaſio</hi> being minded not to be put off with ſuch Noninoes, charged the Conſtable to carry him before a Juſtice of Peace, to which <hi>Ricardo</hi> willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, whether they immediately addreſs'd themſelves; The Juſtice having heard the Allegations on both ſides, perſwaded <hi>Thomaſio</hi> to go along with <hi>Ricardo,</hi> and ſee by fair means to bring his Son home again, and if he were ſo obſtinate he would not return, to take away their Horſes, which would be a means to ſpoil their Knight-Errantry, and that they might go the more lovingly together, he called for a Bottle of Sack to drink them into Unity. The Bottle was no ſooner ſet on the Table, but <hi>Ricardo</hi> vowed himſelf Maſter thereof, and thereupon ſlipping on his <hi>Inviſible-Ring,</hi> he boldly ſteps to the Table, and clapping the Bottle of Sack under his Coat, marched away with it not being deſcerned by any. The Juſtice and <hi>Thomaſio</hi> were ſtricken into a wonderful Amazement to ſee the Bottle go

               <p>In the mean time <hi>Ricardo</hi> was walked to <hi>Jone Grumballs</hi> with his Bottle of Sack, never pulling off his Ring till he came within the Houſe, that not any one might take any Notice of him. Here did he tell her what a trick he ſerved the Juſtice, and that therefore he muſt make all the haſt he could to his Maſter. <hi>Jone</hi> was very well pleaſed with the Jeſt, but much more with her part ſhe had in the Sack, and having drank a Health to <hi>Billy,</hi> ſhe deſired <hi>Ricardo</hi> to ſtay ſo long till ſhe got a Letter in anſwer to his Maſter, which by the School-Maſter of the Town was performed for her in theſe words.</p>

                  <hi>Ricardo</hi> having received the Letter of her, promiſed to be very careful in the delivery of it; and ſhe for her part promiſed him, that when ſhe came to be his Knights Lady, ſhe would be a good Miſtreſs unto him, and help him now and then to a Bitt which her Knight ſhould never know of. <hi>Ricardo</hi> with theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes went away well ſatisfied, yet reſolved with himſelf to keep ſecret the vertue of his <hi>Inviſible-Ring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he was not ſo mindful of returning to his Maſter, as to act ſome Waggeries with his <hi>Inviſible Ring,</hi> which he thought was a better Trade than his Maſter's killing of Gyants, or relieving diſtreſſed Damoſels and Ladies; And Fortune was very favourable to his intentions herein, for he had not gone far, but his Stomach (which was moſt commonly craving) invited him into an Inn to refreſh himſelf, where a Couple of Baylifſs, or Shoulder ſlappers, were ſitting down to dinner with a Shoulder of Mutton and a Capon, having the ſame day ſeized on a poor Man's Goods for an inconſiderable value, which they Sold and Imbezzel'd away at their pleaſure, to the utter Ruine of the poor Man, and maintainance of their Luxury and Drunkenneſs; going ſhares with the Buyers of their ſeiz'd Goods, which by this means they make the greateſt part their own. <hi>Ricardo</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Harpies they were, how that they liv'd by others Ruines, reſolved to put a trick upon them; and therefore they being ſet down to their Victuals without ſaying Grace, as men unacquainted with any Goodneſs, he preſently
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108980:18"/>ſlips on his Ring, and conveys the Capon under his Coat, giving to each of them a blow on the Mouth with his Fiſt, which though they perceived not from whence they came, yet felt they it ſmart to ſome purpoſe; and each thinking the other had ſtruck him, the one ſnatches up the Shoulder of Mutton, and therewith ſtruck his fellow on the Face, who half blinded with Greeſe, and his Cloaths all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeared with dripping, to revenge the affront, got up the platter, and throwing it at the others head, beat him over a Joynt-ſtool, who half dazled with the fall, yet recovering his legs, took the Loaf and therewith brake the others <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ead, who in requital ſnatcht up a Flagon of Beer, and daſhing it in his Fellows Face, he ſo laid on him with the Pot, as if he intended to make Mummy of his Fleſh. <hi>Ricardo</hi> all this while ſtood by, laughing heartily to ſee how they mawled each other, and ſtill at opportunity ſerved lending to each of them ſome blows on the Face, which they not knowing from whence they came, ſought to retaliate upon one another. <hi>Ricardo</hi> to make his revenge more compleat, ſpying a pair of Sciſſers in the Window, took them and cut off their locks of hair; ſo that when they were parted fighting, what with their bloody Noſes, batter'd Faces, and crapt Hair, they look'd moſt rufully.</p>
               <p>But now another Quarrel began to ariſe, the Capon is miſſing, and the two Bayliffs joyning in one, Swear that the Hoſt had couzened them of it whilſt they were fighting; He on the other ſide calls them cheating Rogues, and that they quarrelled on purpoſe to ſteal away his platter, and defraud him of his Reckoning; but vows though they had undone his Neighbour, they ſhould not undo him with their cheating tricks; and thereupon ſends for a Conſtable, vowing he would be paid both for his Meat and the Platter. <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſeeing matters brought to this paſs, marched away with his prize, leaving them to wrangle it out as they could. Now he had not gone far, but (as if he had been born for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Knaves) he overtakes a Horſe-Courſer, one who had ſhaken hands with Honeſty as no fit Companion for his Calling. Him <hi>Ricardo</hi> accoſts, proffering him a Dinner, and Wine to waſh it down at the next Town they came at, which the Horſe Courſer kindly accepts, wondring at this new Friendſhip, and thinking he had got ſome young Cully fluſht with Money, whom he was reſolved to Milk dry e'er he parted with him. So away they were to the next Town, and entring an Inn, call'd for Accommodations to their Capon, which was preſently brought them, and the Glaſſes of Wine trouled about luſtily.</p>
               <p>Whilſt they were thus in their Jollity, there came in a Man from the former Inn, who had ſeen <hi>Ricardo</hi>'s coming thither, but not his going away; And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring how the Capon and Platter were miſſing, and ſeeing ſuch utenſils upon the Table, he challenges <hi>Ricardo</hi> with it, whereupon a great conteſt aroſe; The Horſe-Courſer who had thought he had gotten a prize of his Companion, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it would prove a blank if he were brought in Partners of his Srealth, began with the firſt to fall foul on him. The Hoſteſs ſeeing ſhe had got Cheats to her Gueſts, was as buſie in calling for Money for their Reckoning, ſo that the whole Houſe was on a ſudden in a great Uproar. <hi>Ricardo</hi> knowing that all their ſtir was aimed at him, thought it high time to ſhift for himſelf, and thereupon flipping on his <hi>Inviſible Ring,</hi> took the remainders of the Capon and threw it in his Hoſteſſes Face, and ſent the Platter on the ſame Arrand to the Horſe-Courſer,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108980:19"/>who therewith half blinded, and ſadly mortified, began to cry out in a hideous manner; and that the Informer might not go Scot-free, he alſo up with a Quart pot, and therewith knockt him down, and then Triumphantly marcht away.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was he gone, but the Hoſteſs a little recovering her ſelf, falls foul upon the Horſe-Courſer, ſaying, he had brought the Devil into her Houſe; but notwithſtanding the Devil and all his Imps, ſhe Swore ſhe would make him pay for all the harms was done before he went. The Horſe-Courſer excuſed himſelf, ſaying, he met with him by chance, and that ſhe might ſee by his battered Face and broken Head, he was none of his Confederate. The other Fellow, who had lain all this while in a ſwound, being now a little revived, began to rail upon him more than the Hoſteſs, ſo that the poor Horſe-Courſer, though more batter'd than the other two, could not tell what to do, for notwithſtanding all the excuſes he could make, nothing would be believ'd but that he was the Devil's partner in all this miſchief, and therefore ſhould ſuffer for him if he did not produce him.</p>
               <p>Now was the Horſe-Courſer at his wits end, not knowing what courſe to take; ſometimes he prayed, ſometimes he ſwore, wiſhing all the Imprecations upon himſelf he could reckon up, if he knew the leaſt who it was came with him; but let him uſe what Oaths and Proteſtations he would, they could gain no Credit with them; but ſending for ſome of their Neighbours to help them, they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to throw him into the River to try him for a Witch; but whilſt they were preparing to do it, the Hoſt of the former Inn, with the Bayliffs, hearing how their Capon and Platter was conveyed thither, came to ſeek for it; Theſe Bayliffs knowing the Horſe-Courſer, as moſt commonly Brethren in Iniquity are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted together, got a reprieve for him till the matter could be more deliberately diſcourſed.</p>
               <p>And now they began to reckon up their Miſchances, and to ſhew their Wounds, and conſidering the manner how it was done, they concluded it could be no other than the Devil to puniſh them for their Sins. Then began the Hoſt to tell the Bayliffs of their Swearing and Cruelty, how many ungodly practiſes they uſed to get people in their Clutches, and having them there, how unconſionably they uſed them. The Bayliffs on the other ſide tell the Hoſt and Hoſteſs of their falſe Reckonings, Scoreing with a crotched Chalk, and when people were near fud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, carrying away Flaggons before they were half empty, and frothing them up again, making them pay for whole ones; as alſo how they gave information to Padders and Men of that profeſſion, the quality of the Gueſts that Lodged at their Houſes. The Horſe-Courſer was alſo accuſed for divers deceits in his Occupation, ſo that if his picture be drawn to the Life, you ſhall find him by his qualities to be no other than a Cozening Knave.</p>
               <p>In the mean time their ſuppoſed Devil, <hi>Ricardo,</hi> was gotten beyond the length of their Clutches, leaving them to lament their Loſſes; and now he was minded to return the next day to his Maſter, and to that end went directly to the Farmers where he had left his Horſe; But a new trouble appeared unto him, for he had no Money to pay for his Horſe-keeping; but that difficulty was ſoon over, for paſſing by a Uſurer's Houſe, he heard Money clattering on the Table, and the Door being open, putting on his <hi>Inviſible-Ring,</hi> he went in, where a Poor Man
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108980:19"/>who had borrowed Ten Pounds of this Uſurer, was now come to pay it; which being told, and the Bond Cancel'd, the Uſurer put it up in a Bag of his own, all which <hi>Ricardo</hi> Eyed very narrowly, and no ſooner had he laid it on the Table but <hi>Ricardo</hi> as ſoon took it away. The Uſurer, whoſe Eye like his Heart was always on his Money, ſeeing his Bag to creep away ſo inſenſibly, was quite confounded with Amazement, as it would move a Dog to ſee a Pudding ſtir, and began to call upon him: who before was ſeldom in his thoughts, fearing the Devil, whom he Judged to have drawn away his Bag, would next come for him; and therefore vowed a Reformation of his Courſe of Life; That he would never more take the Rigour of a Forfeiture as ſoon as the day was paſt, nor under Colour of Bonds Writing and Procuration, make the Borrower pay at leaſt Ten or Twelve Shillings in the Hundred; Nay rather than fail, to be preſerv'd from this Danger, he would build an Alms-Houſe to maintain them who had been Ruin'd by his Extortion.</p>
               <p>Now you will ſay it had been good Hanging this Uſurer whilſt he was in this humour, leſt he ſhould be of the ſame Mind with a Maſter of a Ship, who in a great extremity of Danger, promiſed our <hi>Lady</hi> to offer at her Altar, a Candle as great as the main Maſt of his Ship; And when one of his Mates jogging him, told him he had promiſed an impoſſibility; <hi>Tuſh Fool</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>we muſt ſpeak to her fair in time of need; but if ever I come aſhore, I will make her be content with a Candle of ſix to the Pound.</hi> But <hi>Ricardo</hi> was ſomewhat more Conſciencious in his doings, for being got ſafe out of the Uſurers Houſe, he put ſome of the Money in his Pocket, and waiting for the poor Man's return, gave him the reſt, bidding him to be a good Husband with it, and pray for the Squire of the <hi>Inviſible. Ring</hi> for his good Fortune. And ſo leaving the Poor Man over-joy'd, he went towards the Farmers, when paſſing through a Meddow, he ſaw a Maid Milking of a Cow, who was ſweetly ſinging forth this Song.</p>

                  <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſtood amaz'd at the raviſhing Harmony of her Voice, comparing it to the Melody of the Thracian Poet <hi>Orpheus,</hi> when by his Songs he attracted Beaſts, Trees, and Stones to follow him; or rather to the Harmony of the Seraphick Choires; wiſhing himſelf all Ear to liſten to her Song, the pleaſingneſs whereof ſo inſenſibly crept into his Heart, that he became a Thrawl unto her; But firſt he began to conſider whether Squire Errants might have their Miſtreſſes as well as Knights; and many weighty Arguments <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>Con</hi> paſſed in his thoughts; but Love ſo over-ſwayed them all, that he became ſolely captivated to her Affections, and therefore was ſhe no ſooner riſen from Milking her Cow, but he accoſted her on this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſt beautyful Miſtreſs, the attractiag Harmony of your Angelical Voice hath ſo captivated my Heart, that I am become a Sworn Servant to your Vertues, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore among all the Days of my Life, I muſt account this the Happieſt wherein I had the Honour firſt to ſee you; Nor think you have met with an ordinary perſon which ſeeks thus to gain an Intereſt in your Graces; for know I am no leſs than a Squire-Errant to that Renowned Knight at Arms, the invincible and Victorious</hi> Sir Billy of Billerecay, <hi>whoſe Fame begins to ſound all the World over, and whoſe Hiſtory is to be Writ with a brazen Pen, and enroled in the Book of Fame; Let me intreat you therefore to accept of me for your Servant, by which you may come to be as Famous as</hi> Dulcina <hi>my Maſters Lady, and in proceſs of Time the Wife to a Governour of an Iſland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The poor Maid who had never before been acquainted with any Love-Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick above that of a Ballad, or in the Plough-Mans dialect, <hi>Vaith Jone I Love thee;</hi> ſtared upon him as one ſtricken into a ſudden amazement; at laſt ſhe ſaid to him, <hi>Pray Sir do not uſe ſuch hard Words, you ſcare my Cows, and ſpoil my milking. Ricardo</hi> finding he was not rightly underſtood, went towards her, thinking to Salute her; but the Wench as nimbly avoided him, threatning to cry out if he approached any nigher to her; whereupon ſlipping on his <hi>Inviſible-Ring,</hi> he thought to gain his purpoſe that way. The Wench ſeeing him ſo vaniſht on a ſudden, and feeling ſuch ſmattering about her lips, without perceiving any thing, threw down her Milk pail, and ran homewards as faſt as her legs could carry her, ſo that on a ſudden ſhe was gotten out of <hi>Ricardo</hi>'s ſight, who ſeeing her fled, thought it in vain to purſue her, but went on in his intended Journey, until he came to the Farmers.</p>
               <p>Now ſo it was that this Maid whom he had ſo Courted was the Farmers Daughter, who ſeeing <hi>Ricardo</hi> coming, ſqueaked out as if at the ſight of ſome Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or Hob-goblin; having before declared how ſhe was ſerved a Milking, and now crying out, <hi>This, this is the Devil that haunted me.</hi> But the Farmer himſelf knowing <hi>Ricardo,</hi> perſwaded her to the contrary, telling her it was the Man that had left his Horſe with him. And ſo entring into the Houſe, after ſome diſcourſe, <hi>Ricardo</hi> told the Farmer of the affection he bore to his Daughter, and the better to gain his good will, how he was the Squire to a Knight Errant, who Conquered Kingdoms at his Pleaſure, and how himſelf ſhould be a Governour of an Iſland at leaſt: and for that which had befell his Daughter, it was only things done by Inchantment, to which Knights Errant and their Squires are very Subject.</p>

Now by my Ferkens</hi> (quoth ſhe) <hi>for ought I know, this</hi> Squire Errant <hi>may be no better than the</hi> Knave of Clubs <hi>to the</hi> King and Queen of Hearts, <hi>and therefore let his Maſter Conquer Kingdoms and Iſlands for who-ſo-ever he will, but this skip-jack, this</hi> Hocus Pocus <hi>ſhall never be any Husband of mine.</hi>

               <p>This anſwer was ſomething a cooling Card to <hi>Ricardo,</hi> but comforting himſelf, upon her Fathers words, he thought that time might alter her mind, and for the preſent he knew not what to do with a Wife if he had her. He therefore reſolved ſhe ſhould be his Miſtreſs, and to bear the Name of <hi>Dowzabella,</hi> which Name he promiſed to make as Famous by his Acts as that of <hi>Sabra</hi> the beloved Miſtreſs of St. <hi>George,</hi> or <hi>Philotheta</hi> the Lady of <hi>Montelion, Knight of the Oracle. Away you Fool,</hi> ſaid the Wench, <hi>and ſpare your ſtrength to throw ae Cudgel at a Paere-Tree, or your Activity in being the beſt Man at a match at Foot-Ball; and meddle not with a Sword as a Weapon out of your element, but betake you to a flail as moſt fit for your Employment.</hi>

                  <hi>Ricardo</hi> hearing theſe Words, thought it in vain to ſtay any longer there, and therefore paying the Farmer for keeping his Horſe, deſiring <hi>Dowzabella</hi> to retain a better Opinion of him, he mounted his Steed and returned towards his Maſter.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 8.</hi> How <hi>Ricardo</hi> delivered his meſſage to his Maſter, and of the Challenge made by Sir <hi>Billy</hi> againſt all comers, in Honour of his Miſtreſs <hi>Dulcina.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>SIR <hi>Billy</hi> had waited with great impatience the coming of his Squire, deſirous to know how his Letter was entertained by his Miſtreſs <hi>Dulcina,</hi> as alſo wanting his Company in purſuance of more Adventures, when to his great Satisfaction his Squire arrived, with the Joyful Tydings of the kind reception he had of that peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs piece of Beauty as he ſtiled her, Aggravating her perfections to ſuch a height, as if ſhe had been changed from a Blowze to an Angelical Feature ſince Sir <hi>Billy</hi> ſaw her. And to compleat his Joy the more he delivered him the Letter from her, which having received how often did he read, and read again the Superſcription of it, it being directed <hi>to that Puiſſant and Magnanimous Knight at Arms, the moſt redoubted Sir</hi> Billy <hi>of</hi> Billerecay; but when he had read the contents therein contained, he was ſo tranſported with an Extaſy of Joy, as if he had been placed in the Apogean or Zenith of all happineſs. And can it be poſſible (ſaid he) that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108980:21"/>my Lady <hi>Dulcina</hi> takes ſuch Notice of the Actions of her Knight? has Fames Trumpet already blown my praiſe unto her Ears? What then will it be when I ſhall have performed ſuch Acts worthy to be Eterniz'd in Fames eternal Bead-Roll.</p>
               <p>As he was thus applauding his own ſuppoſed happineſs, his Hoſt the Sage <hi>Freſton</hi> came in, who ſeeing <hi>Ricardo,</hi> welcomed him with great demonſtrations of Love, inquiring after the welfare of his Lady <hi>Dulcina,</hi> and how he ſped in his Meſſage unto her; to all which <hi>Ricardo</hi> gave very plauſible anſwers, according to what he though would beſt pleaſe his Maſter. When (ſaid he) I firſt came to that Idea of Beauty, ſhe was ſweetly breaking the yielding Air with her Harmonious voice, which ſo ſweetly ſhe breathed forth, as was able to make the Rocks to dance, and ſurly Beaſts ſtand attentive to hear her; the whilſt her white hands (in whoſe compariſon all whites are Ink) was ſewing with a Needle, which with ſo pretty a manner made his paſſage too and fro thorough the Cloth, as if it were loth to have gone from ſuch a Miſtreſs, but that it hoped to return thitherward very quickly again. Thus did her Voice and Hands keep pace in an equal proportion, as if her hands were won by the Attraction of her Voice to work, or her Voice were taught to Sing by the Harmonious conſort of her hands. But when this Mirror of Beauty did caſt an Eye upon me, and with what a due Reverence I approached to deliver my meſſage unto her, ſhe left off Singing, and with ſuch a ſmile as <hi>Venus</hi> the Queen of Beauty gave to <hi>Anchiſes,</hi> ſhe received the Letter from me, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient till ſhe had read the Contents thereof, which both by her words and looks I found to be very ſatisfactory unto her. But <hi>Ricardo,</hi> ſaid the Sage <hi>Freſton,</hi> you have not as yet told us what Song your Lady or Miſtreſs was then ſinging when you came unto her? O that ſaid he, can I well Remember, for I have ſeen it in a Ballad glewed upon many an Ale-houſe wall, and it begins thus.</p>
               <l>When as King <hi>Henry</hi> rul'd this Land,</l>
               <l>The Second of that Name,</l>
               <l>Beſides his Queen he dearly Lov'd,</l>
               <l>A fair and Princely Dame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </l>
               <p>Indeed ſaid the Sage <hi>Freſton,</hi> I gueſt it was either that or the Ballad of <hi>Chevy-Chaſe,</hi> as conſiſting the one of Love, the other of War, being both Concomitants of Knight Errantry Now by the Honour of my Knighthood (ſaid Sir <hi>Billy</hi>) I queſtion not but in time to perform ſuch Acts as ſhall ſurpaſs e'er a <hi>Percy</hi> or <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> of them all, and make Work for all the Ballad makers that ſhall live in ſucceeding Ages, when they have once read the Hiſtory that ſhall be written of my Life; And therefore <hi>Ricardo</hi> let it be your Care to provide for our ſudden departure, ſince Knights Errant were not born to ſleep out their time in the Beds of Eaſe, but to be ſtill ſeeking out for Adventures, as Men made all of Fire, of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted high erected Spirits, as to make the Dead quake in their Graves to think of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ricardo,</hi> who was always more addicted to feeding than fighting, as one who had indented with the Grave to bring all his Limbs thither, and not to loſe one Joynt of them by Quarrelling; liked not at all of this propoſal, having found better Entertainment from the Gentleman than he could expect from his Maſter;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108980:21"/>yet truſting to the vertue of his <hi>Inviſible Ring,</hi> by which he queſtioned not but to help himſelf in all his extremities, he freely condeſcended unto it. But the Sage <hi>Freſton</hi> deſirous to ſee what was contained in <hi>Jone Grumball</hi>'s Letter, thus ſpake to Sir <hi>Billy. I make no queſtion moſt Heroick Knight, but the Lady of your affections, who is ſo much Honour'd in having ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> Servant, has ſo pleaſed your expectation in her moſt gracious Anſwer, as hath given you ſatisfaction in her Love and Loyalty unto you; and were it not an high preſumption in me to beg ſuch a boon, I ſhould think my ſelf happy in the peruſal oſ ſuch lines as muſt needs fall from ſuch a mellifluous Pen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I were very unworthy, ſaid</hi> Sir <hi>Billy, of ſuch tranſcendent Favours I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from you, ſhould I deny you ſuch a ſmall requeſt;</hi> and thereupon he ſhewed him her Letter; which when the Sage <hi>Freſton</hi> had read, as it were in admiration, he brake forth into theſe expreſſions. <hi>O the excellency of Natural Wit! the Magazine of Eloquence! rich Soul of Language, a tenth Muſe, whom all the Muſes Court; the whole Monopoly of Wit, a branch of</hi> Minerva's <hi>Olive, well worthy the Affections of the moſt Heroick Knight in the whole World; How happy art thou</hi> Sir <hi>Billy in the Choice of ſuch a Miſtreſs, whoſe parts are ſo tranſcendent, ſhe may well be ſtiled the epitomy of all Perfections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Billy</hi> was not a little proud of his Ladies praiſes, verily conceiting her to be ſuch a one as the Sage <hi>Freſton</hi> had painted her forth, the Wonder of Nature, and Quinteſſence of perfection; ſaying, <hi>he would have a Solemn Juſts proclaimed in the next Prince's Court he came at, wherein by the ſtrength of his Invincible Arm he would maintain his Lady</hi> Dulcina <hi>to be the Phaenix of Beauty, and the Non-parelia of this Age:</hi> and accordingly gave order to be gone the next Morning, but that <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſtayed his Journey by a new deviſed Trick, which he brought to paſs in this manner.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Billy</hi> uſed every Evening to walk in the Garden, with his hands indented one with another, as melancholy as a Gyb'd Cat, his Thoughts of Chevalry being made ſo habitual to him, as it was now become part of his Nature; In this poſture as he was walking, his truſty Squire ſlipping on his <hi>Inviſible-Ring,</hi> ſaluted him with a Crab-Tree Cudgel overthwart his ſhoulders, laying it on ſo luſtily that Sir <hi>Billy</hi> thought himſelf engaged in one of thoſe imaginary fights which he had read in his Books of Knight-Errantry, and drawing his Sword began to ſtrike, but knew not at what, at laſt he heard a Voice which ſpake to him in this manner.</p>
               <l>Sir Knight before thou doſt depart,</l>
               <l>From forth the place whereas thou art,</l>
               <l>Thou muſt maintain thy Ladies Fame,</l>
               <l>'Gainſt any ſhall oppoſe the ſame;</l>
               <l>Which if thou doſt refuſe, then know,</l>
               <l>Thou ſhalt receive full many a blow.</l>
               <p>Sir <hi>Billy</hi> hearing a voice, but ſeeing no Body, might have thought it an illuſion, but that the blows which he felt aſſured him the contrary; wherefore to avoid receiving any more, he thus ſaid, <hi>whoſoever thou art that thus ſpeakeſt unto me, know thy mind ſhall be fulfilled; But let me deſire to know from whence this meſſage came, that when I have finiſhed the Adventure, I may know by whoſe appointment
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108980:22"/>I undertook it.</hi> To whom the voice anſwered, <hi>I am a Spirit ſent from the wiſe</hi> Urganda <hi>the Lady of the Woods, to warn thee not to ſtir whilſt thou haſt performed my Command, elſe ſhall I haunt thee with revenge whetherſoever thou goeſt.</hi> And hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus ſaid, he withdrew himſelf without the Garden Gate, and ſlipping off his <hi>Inviſible-Ring,</hi> came walking towards his Maſter, who with great earneſtneſs told him of this Adventure, and ſo both of them together went to the Sage <hi>Freſton,</hi> and acquainted him with it, wherefore it was agreed on all ſides that a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge ſhould be written, and Meſſengers ſent abroad into all parts to publiſh the ſame; which Challenge Sir <hi>Billy</hi> himſelf would needs endite, which he did in theſe words.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 9.</hi> How Sir <hi>Billy</hi> was forced to run from his Challenge, the Mirth <hi>Ricardo</hi> had at a Wedding, what a Trick he ſerved an Old Fornicator, and how he went in perſuit of his Maſter.</head>
               <p>AMongſt other places whether the Fame of this Challenge did ſpread, was the Town of <hi>Billerecay,</hi> wherein dwelt <hi>Thomaſio</hi> the Father of Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> who hearing of his Sons challenge, reſolved to encounter him with a Juſtices Warrant for the recovery of his two Horſes, and if it were poſſible to change his Son from a Knight Errant to a Plough-Man again, and withal threatning to have <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſeverely puniſhed; to which purpoſe he eaſily obtained a Warrant of the ſame Juſtice from whom <hi>Ricardo</hi> before had taken away the Bottle of Wine. And being thus armed with better Authority than his Son had for his Knight-Errantry, he took his way directly to the Sage <hi>Frestons,</hi> where he had taken Sir <hi>Billy</hi> Napping, had not <hi>Ricardo</hi> by chance heard of his coming: for <hi>Thomaſio</hi> whom Age had brought to the downfal of his mellow Years, being, as moſt Old Men are, very Tuchy and Cholerick, could not forbear to give out threatning
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108980:22"/>Words what he would do unto them, before he had gotten his prey into his hand Wherefore <hi>Ricardo</hi> having notice of his intent, was minded to fruſtrate his ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pectation, and giving his Maſter <hi>Billy</hi> notice thereof, he ſpeedily packed him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, himſelf ſtaying behind to ſee what would be the event thereof, not doubting when the worſt came, to come off well enough by the help of his <hi>Inviſible-Ring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed he quickly found himſelf to have need of ſuch help, for <hi>Thomaſio</hi> finding his Son <hi>Billy</hi> to have eſcaped his hands, reſolved <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſhould pay for all and ſo by vertue of his Warrant ſeized upon him, threatning him with ſo many puniſhments, and ſuch diverſity of Torments, that if words would have done it, <hi>Ricardo</hi> had dyed a Thouſand Deaths: In this paſſion he was hurried before the Sage <hi>Freston,</hi> who (as we told you before,) was Juſtice of thoſe parts; to whom <hi>Thomaſio</hi> made a grievous complaint, how that <hi>Ricardo</hi> was both a Thief and a Conjurer, that he had ſtolen his Horſes, and intic'd away his Son, and for ought he knew made him away, and therefore deſired he might be ſeverely puniſhed: <hi>But Sir</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>if you have not a care he will eſcape your hands, for he hath learned</hi> Hocus pocus <hi>tricks during his</hi> Knight Raſcality, <hi>by which he can make himſelf and Bottles of Wine to become Inviſible, as he ſerved our Juſtice not long ago; and therefore I do accuſe him for a Witch, and that as a Witch he may be burnt to death at a ſtake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this <hi>Ricardo</hi> anſwered, <hi>that he had done nothing but what was warrantable by the Laws of Knight-Errantry according as his Maſter had informed him; for</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>did you ever read in any Books of Chevalry that Knights-Errant and their Squires went about to ſeek out Adventures on Foot? and therefore ſince his Maſter muſt have Horſes, who could furniſh him better than his Father? Nor are we</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>to be troubled or moleſted for whatſoever we do, ſince Knights Errant are Lawleſs, and if the Knights be Lawleſs, by conſequence the Squires are Lawleſs too.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ricardo's</hi> words made the whole Company to laugh; when in the very nick of time came the Juſtice of <hi>Billerecay,</hi> from whom <hi>Ricardo</hi> had taken the Bottle of Wine, invited thither by the Fame of Sir <hi>Billy's</hi> Challenge; <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſeeing him come, thought it was time to be gone, thinking he would diſcloſe the Trick he had ſhown him, which indeed he quickly did in all its circumſtances; but the ſtrangeneſs of the thing could gain no Credence with the Sage <hi>Freſton,</hi> who ſaid he would try if he could ſerve him ſuch a Trick; and thereupon commanded three or four Bottles of Sack to be fetched and ſet on the Table; <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſeeing and hearing all what was done, thought it now high time to act his part, and thereupon ſlipping on his <hi>Ring,</hi> he ſeizes upon two of the Bottles, and clapping them under his Coat, marched cleverly away with them, to the Aſtoniſhment of all there preſent, eſpecially to the Sage <hi>Freſton,</hi> who now began to think that <hi>Ricardo</hi> and his Maſter, inſtead of two ſimple Fellows were a couple of crafty Knaves.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding <hi>Ricardo</hi> went away laughing with his Booty, yet was his heart ſorrowful, as dreading what would be the effects of that which they had done; for though he put great confidence in his <hi>Inviſible-Ring</hi> as a ſure protection for him in all his extremities, yet hearing how vehemently Old
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108980:23"/>
                  <hi>Thomaſio</hi> had accuſed him for Witchcraft, and that if he ſhould be taken unawares, before he could put the <hi>Ring</hi> on his Finger, it might be taken from him, and all his forepaſſed actions laid to his Charge; which laſt he had committed he thought would be none of the leaſt, in abuſing him by whom they had been ſo kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained; for now he perceived that notwithſtanding all his Maſters brags of Conquering Caſtles and Iſlands, the purchaſe they were likelieſt to get was only a Jayle. He therefore reſolved not to expoſe himſelf to any danger more than needs muſt, and to that purpoſe kept the <hi>Ring</hi> on his Finger until he travelled many Miles, whereby he prevented his being taken by thoſe which the Sage <hi>Freſton</hi> had ſent after him. For theſe two Juſtices after his departure, ſeeing how they were deluded, had ſent both Horſe and Man to take him; ſome of which <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſaw paſs by him, enquiring of every one they met after ſuch a perſon; When a new project came into <hi>Ricardo</hi>'s Head to make them leave off their purſuit, which was this.</p>
               <p>He gets behind an Oak, and making an hideous noiſe, as it were the croak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Ravens, bellowing of Bulls, and braying of Aſſes mixt together, which made them all ſtand ſtill as amaz'd at what they heard; and having gotten them ſo together, with a loud bellowing voice thus he ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am the Oak which the ancients of Old Conſecrated to</hi> Jupiter, <hi>in whoſe Name I ſtraitly charge ye to perſue no further after</hi> Ricardo <hi>Squire to the Invincible Knight at Arms Sir</hi> Billy <hi>of</hi> Billerecay, <hi>ſeeing he is one whom we have taken into our ſafe Protection, and whoſoever ſhall offer him the leaſt Injury, we ſhall be ſeverely revenged on him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The meſſengers hearing ſuch a hideous Voice, and ſeeing no perſon, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they rounded the Oak Tree twice or thrice about, were won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully amazed, not knowing what to do; and there being never a Knight-Errant amongſt them (which fear no danger, but are fool-hardy in all attempts) they thereupon concluded to return home, as being ſufficiently warranted, by the voice which they heard, which when <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſaw, he laughed heartily to himſelf at thoſe Sons of fear, as men who were afraid of the Swords which themſelves wore, and affrighted at the claſhing of their own Armor.</p>
               <p>The meſſengers thus returning homewards with a ſleeveleſs excuſe of a fruitleſs Arrand, <hi>Ricardo</hi> paſſed on his way, but ſtill diverſity of thoughts perplexed his mind, what Courſe of Life to take; whether to ſeek out his Maſter <hi>Billy</hi> and purſue Squire Errantry, or to live by the ſhifts of his <hi>Inviſible-Ring,</hi> at laſt he reſolved with himſelf to go to his Maſter, knowing his Neceſſities to be ſo great, that without his help he was not able to ſupport them, having left behind him both his Horſe and Armor, by which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared (at leaſt in ſhow) not like a Knight Errant, and therefore neither he nor his Squire acceptable to thoſe places whether they ſhould come</p>
               <p>Now as he travelled along (often taking a ſup of the Bottle to cheer his heart) he overtook a Fidler who was going to play at a Wedding at the next Village, with whom <hi>Ricardo</hi> conſorted, and to endear his Company the more, as they went, ſitting down under an aged Oak, whoſe ſpreading boughs ſheltered them from the heat of <hi>Sols</hi> burning rayes, which with his orient treſſes caſt a radient luſtre over the World, there they emptied the remainder

               <p>
                  <hi>My truſty Squire</hi> (ſaid Sir <hi>Billy</hi>) <hi>I were not worthy to be thy Maſter ſhould I deny thee ſo ſmall a requeſt; Know then that after ſuch time I parted from thee, (occaſioned by the unfortunate purſuit of my Father, by the malign influence of ſome Croſs-grain'd Planet, or rather the hatred of wicked Spirits and Negro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancers which they bear to Knights Errant,) wandring whether Fortune was pleas'd to guide me, I came to a certain Caſtle, where I heard of an Adventure of a flying Negromancer.</hi> And ſo related all had befallen him as you heard before; only imputing his Misfortunes to the Malice of Magicians and Inchanters, and how he was reſcued from them by <hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ricardo</hi> heard all with great ſeeming attention, and now began to counſel his Maſter, that ſeeing that Knight Errantry was attended with ſo many troubles and dangers to leave it off; but Sir <hi>Billy</hi> would by no means condeſcend thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; ſaying, <hi>That the immortal Honour attained by Arms, could not be purchaſed without much hazard and danger, the rugged Paths leading thereunto being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paved with Perils; an Ounce of Honour coſting a Pound of Blood. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Ricardo</hi>) <hi>ſince the purchaſe is ſo dear, far better it is to let it alone; what avails Honour in the Grave, nor will it without Money purchaſe the Belly full of Victuals.</hi>

               <p>Sir <hi>Billy</hi> was ſo incenſed againſt <hi>Ricardo</hi> for theſe as he thought Cowardly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, that in a great rage he burſt forth into this exclamation. <hi>O thou Dasterdly Son of Fear, thou off ſpring of</hi> Clinias <hi>and</hi> Dametas, <hi>that wouldeſt ſooner creep into a Scabbard than draw a Sword; that at the approach of danger, art ready to run away from thy ſelf, like the Satyr that ran away at the Noiſe of the Horn which he himſelf blew; being ready to Sink at the very Name of Wounds and Scars, as if thou hadſt indented with the Grave to bring all thy Limbs thither. Thinkeſt thou ſuch a Cowardly paſſion and fear ſhall ever take poſſeſſion of the leaſt Limb about me? No, know that I am of ſuch undaunted, high, erected Spirit, as may make the Dead Quake in their Grave to think of me; who if I ſhould not live to enjoy the Honour pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with my Blood, yet will I leave the World my Executor, to whom I will bequeath the rich inheritance of my Memory.</hi>

Sir <hi>Billy</hi> was of opinion that Knight Errantry would warrant them to take Horſes in any place where they could find them; but <hi>Ricardo</hi> who valued his Life more than Sir <hi>Billy</hi> did his, and who of all Deaths dreaded that moſt of being Hang'd up in the Air like a Dog, was altogether againſt it. He therefore (truſting to the vertue of his <hi>Inviſible Ring</hi>) told his Maſter, that if he would abſcond himſelf for a little ſpace, in ſome place where he might know to find him again, he would undertake through his Ingenuity, to help them to their Old Horſes. <hi>But how can this be done</hi> (ſaid Sir <hi>Billy,</hi>) <hi>without force of Arms, and who more pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>But <hi>Ricardo</hi> would by no means yield to that, telling his Maſter, <hi>That the way to get their Horſes again muſt be accompliſhed by Policy, and not by force of Arms; and though he knew him to be as valiant as the Renowned</hi> Hercules, <hi>or the valerous Champion St.</hi> George <hi>for</hi> England, <hi>yet many times were things brought to paſs by weak means, which the greatest strength nor Manhood could do.</hi>

Here he ſtaid expecting their Company, not minding to hide himſelf, as being ſecured by his <hi>Inviſible-Ring,</hi> nor indeed was there any need thereof, for preſently after, had Night hid the Face of the Earth with her
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:108980:28"/>Sable pinions, and the <hi>Jolly Charioter</hi> hurl'd her black Mantle o're the Hemiſphre; whereupon thoſe Gueſts who liv'd near repaired home, and old <hi>Thomaſio,</hi> and the reſt who lodged there, went to their Beds, the better to riſe betimes the next Morning.</p>
               <p>And now was the time come for the two Lovers to meet, which for their more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity they did ſeverally; and firſt the Wench, a long ſtrapping Jade, come in as gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly as if ſhe trod on the points of Needles, or ſlippery Ice, who having ſtript her ſelf, and got into the Bed, immediately followed her Mate, a ſtout lubberly Fellow, but brawney Back't, ſufficiently able to ſatisfie her appetite: He alſo pulling off his Cloaths, went to Bed to her; which <hi>Ricardo</hi> perceiving, and that their Cloaths lay apart from the Bed, he got them up under his Arm, and as ſoftly as was poſſible, carried them out of the Room with him; and finding the Key in the Door with as much ſilence as a dark Night was capable of he locked it, and finding all the whole Houſhold bathing their weary Temples in the dew of ſleep, after he had ſet open the Street-Door for a free paſſage for himſelf to go out, he with a <hi>Stentorian</hi> voice cryed out, Fire, Fire in the Maids Chamber; which ſo allarum'd the Houſe, that in an inſtant they were all gotten to the Chamber-Door, which finding lockt, they rapt and bounced at it as Men who ſaid we muſt and will come in. The two Lovers who were buſie in their Amorous imbraces, hearing ſuch a noiſe, were more amazed than <hi>Circes</hi> Priſoners when they felt themſelves turned into Beaſts; and ſearching for their Cloaths, when they could find none, were almoſt at their Wits end.</p>
               <p>Thoſe on the other ſide who were buſie at the Door, hearing them not come to open it, thought they were ſmothered in the Fire, and at laſt with much a do broke open the Door; but ſeeing no Fire, nor any ſign of Fire, they ſtruck a light and walked in, where ſcarching narrowly, they found the two Lovers ſtark-naked under the Bed. This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected ſight turned their fear into an exceeding laughter, but the two poor Lovers were ſo confounded with ſhame that they could not ſpeak; imagining the Devil had been there himſelf in proper Perſon and fetched away their Cloaths. And now their Miſtreſs who alſo had come running headlong in the fright, began to introgate them, how and by what means they were there together, and where were there Cloaths? When the Wench looking wiſtly upon her, ſpyed a Man's Hoſe on her Leg, which ſhe knew to be a Gentleman's that oft frequented the Houſe, and that Night was come thither; whereupon miſtruſting that which indeed happened to be true, ſhe ſtarted up of a was ſudden, and ran as faſt as ſhe could to her Miſtreſſes Bed, into which ſhe entred, and no ſooner there but ſhe ſound her ſelf in the Gentleman's Arms who owed the Hoſe her Miſtreſs had on: He thinking her to be his, and the Miſtreſs of the Houſe; But before he could ask her any queſtions what was the cauſe of this hurley burley, ſome of the people were come running after the Wench, and there found that the Miſtreſs was equally concerned with the Maid. And now the Gentleman was as much abaſhed as the young Man before, not only to ſee himſelf taken in that manner, but alſo with one whom he eſteemed a far greater diſparagement than if it had been her Miſtreſs; nor could he well tell, being acted in the dark, if this ſame were not his former Bedfellow, thinking her Miſtreſs might put a trick upon him. The Miſtreſs her ſelf ſeeing things thus acted, ſlipped into another Room, and putting on ſome other Cloaths, appeared amongſt them as one whoſe Soul ſat enthroned with Spotleſs Innocence, and ſought to perſwade the ſtanders by, that the Maid had only run thither to hide herſelf, deeply proteſting (which ſhe might eaſily do) that the Gentleman was as innocent as her ſelf.</p>
               <p>But now here was another queſtion, how the Gentleman ſhould come into the Miſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Bed? Now old <hi>Thomaſio</hi> who had alſo riſen with the reſt, alarum'd at the Noiſe of a Fire in the Houſe, would needs perſwade them, that all was done by Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:108980:28"/>telling them what had happened in his Town, as alſo what they had ſeen in their own, how his Son's Sword without help of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Whilſt they were thus arguing the caſe, <hi>Ricardo</hi> was as buſie in ordering of the Cloaths he had brought out of the Chamber, which he fixed upon two poles, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome glimmering light by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <l>To puniſh Leachery, and for no Theft,</l>
               <l>Theſe Cloaths were took away, and here are left.</l>
               <p>By this time the Morning began to dawn, and the blooming light to bluſh from the Eaſt, the Sun by degrees gilding the Horizon with his radiance; whereupon Old <hi>Thomaſio</hi> reſolved not to go to his Bed again, but to prepare for his going home; and to that end went into the Stable, and bringing out his own and his Son's Horſe, laid Sir <hi>Billy</hi>'s Armor on the one, intending to ride on the other; and having fitted all things to his purpoſe, hung his Horſes at the Door, what he went in to pay his Reckoning. <hi>Ricardo</hi> who ſtood by all this while undiſcern'd, neglected not this opportunity, but untying the Horſes, got up, and away he went with them as hard as he could drive.</p>
               <p>Some of the Servants ſeeing the Horſes thus to run away as they thought of themſelves, told <hi>Thomaſio</hi> what had happened, who with a Sorrowful Countenance looked after them, as who ſhould take his laſt farewel of them, <hi>Now the vengeance light on that wicked Varlot</hi> (ſaid he, wringing his hands, and tearing the little remainder of his Hair from off his Head) <hi>did not I tell you that what was done in this Houſe to Night was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Ricardo</hi> having gotten on Horſe-Back made as much haſt as if he had been flying from Death, ſo that in ſhort ſpace he was gotten clean out of ſight; nor did he much ſlacken his pace till he came where his Maſter was, who having ſpyed him with the two Horſes, he was ready to leap out of his skin for Joy, being more glad than is the teeming Earth to ſee the long'd for Sun, or the tyred Sea-man to deſcry Land; <hi>My truſty Squire</hi> (ſaid Sir <hi>Billy</hi>) <hi>more welcome art thou unto me, than was the wandring</hi> Ulyſſes <hi>after his Ten Years Travels to the chast</hi> Penelope; <hi>nay far more welcome than Health to the diſeaſed Perſon, or drink unto the thirſty Soul.

               <p>But <hi>Ricardo</hi> thinking himſelf not ſafe ſo near, deſired his Maſter to mount his Horſe and be going from thence; but Sir <hi>Billy</hi> would not ſtir till he had ſurveyed his Armor, and finding his due order, he armed himſelf, and then beſtriding <hi>Bellerophon,</hi> which he had not done in many a day before, he pranced on his back in as much ſtate as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>Hector</hi> before the Walls of <hi>Ilium.</hi> So proceeding on their way, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Nature of Knights Errant, is, <hi>never out of their way,</hi> they came to a Town where was a Fair kept that day, which Sir <hi>Billy</hi> Fancied to be the Camp of ſome Pagan Army, and therefore reſolved to ſet upon them, and with his ſingle proweſs to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them; where how he ſped in his attempt, you ſhall hear in the Chapter following.</p>

               <p>SIR <hi>Billy</hi> ſeeing before him ſo many Booths and Stalls, with a multitude of people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, called to <hi>Ricardo,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>My moſt faithful Squire, partaker with me in all my Troubles and Adventures; Now are we come to the brink of Honour, the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Fame, that great engagement to great purpoſe, which ſhall raiſe our Names from the black edicts of a Tyrant Grave. Know then that this is the Camp of that wicked Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the cruel Pagan Prince</hi> Brontes, <hi>who with an Army of miſcreant Soldiers wandreth about the World ſpoyling and deſtroying all whereſoever he comes; Now is the time come for my Victorious Arm to put a period to all his miſchiefs; this is the allotted ſeaſon to put an end to his damnable deſigns, and to raiſe a Pyramid of praiſe to my ſelf by deſtroying ſuch a brood of inſolent Vermin. And therefore</hi> Ricardo <hi>ſtand thou ſtill and be a Spectator of my valerous performances.</hi> And therewithal putting his Launce into his Reſt, offer'd to run againſt the multitude; which <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſeeing, with a voice as loud as the bawling of the Oyſter-Wives at <hi>Billingsgate,</hi> cryed unto him; <hi>Ah Wretch bereft of ſence, ſeeſt thou that is not an Army of Pagans, but very Chriſtian men, yea ſuch very Chriſtian Men as inhabit in our Pariſh; I tell thee miſled Maſter of mine, it is a Fair, and ſuch a Fair as is kept by Pedlars at our Town of</hi> Billerecay <hi>on the</hi> 22d <hi>day of</hi> July. But Sir <hi>Billy</hi> who imagined every thing to be as he had read in his Books of Knight Errantry, would hear no reaſon, but ſpurring <hi>Belerophon</hi> with winged haſt rode to the Fair, and inſtantly overthrew two or three Pedlars ſtalls. <hi>Vile Miſereants</hi> (ſaid Sir <hi>Billy</hi>) <hi>whoſe wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſuch as makes the Earth groan to ſupport your weight; to whom Murthers are but reſolute acts, and Treaſons matte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The Pedlars who had been damnified by Sir <hi>Billy</hi>'s adventure, hearing his terrible threatning words, and ſeeing the ſpoil he had already done, thought it was beſt to beſtir themſelves; and ſnatching up ſome poles, the broken remainders of their Stalls, they ſet upon Sir <hi>Billy</hi> on every ſide, ſome before, and ſome behind him, that at length they knockt down the Knight Errant, who lay ſtreaking for Life under his Horſes heels. Then began they to gather up their Wares, which confuſedly lay ſtrewed upon the Ground; Here a parcel of Jews-Trumps quite out of Tune, their Babies, Rattles, Tumblers, Boxes, all Trophies of Sir <hi>Billy</hi>'s Manhood, who lay all this while in a Trance.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe things were a doing, <hi>Ricardo</hi> that he might ſee the end of his Maſter's adventure, having ſecured his Horſe, ſlipped on his <hi>Inviſible Ring,</hi> and following after, ſaw all what had betided him, which made him almoſt half out of Love with following any more the purſuit of Knight Errantry: Yet not to leave his Maſter in this diſtreſs, whilſt the Pedlars were buſie in gathering up their Goods, he went and pulled him from under his Horſes Feet, where he lay as ſenſleſs as was his undertaking the Adventure, with a broken head, and no doubt his brains had flown about had he had any in his Skull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ricardo</hi> having gotten his Maſter from under his Horſes Feet, wrapped his own Cloak about him, and ſo carried him away Inviſible, when returning to fetch his Horſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:108980:29"/>the Game ſhould not go ſo, and having on his <hi>Inviſible Ring,</hi> and a good Battoon in his hand, he ſtruck the party with the ſame who had hold of the Horſe, he feeling it ſmart, and not knowing from whence the blow came, with as much eagerneſs ſtruck at another, and that other again at a fourth, ſo that in an inſtant, parts taking, ſix or ſeven of them were together by the ears. Whilſt this Game at Handy-Fiſts was thus playing, <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſhifted away with the Horſe, and they having ſoundly batter'd each other, and not knowing well why this quarrel was begun, began to have a breathing ſpace, but then looking for the Horſe from whence they all hoped for ſatisfaction, and finding him to be gone as well as his Maſter, they each of them thought the other had conveyed him away, whereby a new quarrel aroſe betwixt them, and from words again to blows more ſharp and eager than before.</p>
               <p>But the caſe was not ſo Tragical on their ſide, as it was on <hi>Ricardo</hi>'s, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning with the Horſe to his Maſter, found him without ſenſe or motion, as one inro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the regiſter of death, and ready to caſt off the robe of Clay, and drop into the Grave. <hi>Ricardo</hi> finding him in this condition, was almoſt at his wits end, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to do, nor whether to have him, his Maſter by going about to redreſs wrongs, having committed ſo many, that ſcarce was any place ſafe for them to reſort to.</p>
               <p>In this uncouth condition, as he was ruminating what to do, came by an Old Man with Grizly Hairs, one whoſe Fortunes were out at the heels, as his Cloaths were out at the Elbows, in ſum, a Beggar, whoſe hourly wants made him trudge from place to place for relief. He hearing <hi>Ricardo's</hi> complaint, and imagining his Maſter to have been one of the <hi>High-Pad,</hi> and therefore wanted a place to repoſe himſelf, told <hi>Ricardo</hi> that if he would go along with him, he would help him to a convenience anſwerable to his deſire, a place which by the coverture of tall ſpreading Trees, was inviſible to the Rayes of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and hid from the radiance of each ſparkling Star. <hi>Recardo</hi> entertained this motion as a voice from Heaven, and with many thankful words accepted of his proffer; ſo taking Sir <hi>Billy</hi> up on the Horſe for fear of being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, they haſted away, and by direction of the Old Man came to a place where Solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs it ſelf might be ſaid to dwell, being Scituated in the midſt of a Thicket of Trees, Quick-ſet-Hedges, and Buſhes; here did they enter into a Cottage erected on purpoſe for the entertainment of Beggars, Mumpers, and ſuch kind of people, where they freely ſpend the Coin they get in begging, having general randezvouzes there at certain times of the Year. To this ſtately Manſton did they bring that Victorious Knight at Arms, Sir <hi>Billy</hi> of <hi>Billerecay,</hi> where having disburden'd his Horſe of him, they carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to a Bed, who all this while lay as if his Soul were Eclipſed from his Body. Now <hi>Ricardo</hi> being ſolicitous for a Surgeon, this old <hi>Mumper</hi> who was skilful in making of <hi>Clymes,</hi> and raiſing bliſters on legs to move people to compaſſion, and healing them again at his pleaſure; he voluntarily undertook to be Sir <hi>Billy's</hi> Chyrurgion; and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring ſome ſmall matter unto him, our Knight, as if new riſen from ſome Trance, began to open his Eyes, and after two or three yauns, ſtretching out his legs, and fetching a deep ſigh, he ſaid, <hi>Think not proud Pagans though you have unhorſed me, for to prevail: It is not all your Magical Charms that can daunt my Valour, or make me to repent my enterprize upon ye.</hi> When looking aſide, ſpying the Old Beggar, whom for diſtinction ſake we will call <hi>Gerion. And thou curſed Prince</hi> Brontes (ſaid he) <hi>who art the head of this miſchievous rout, now ſhall thy wickedneſs return upon thine own head, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that I ſhall inflict upon thee be ſo terrible, that Babes unborn ſhall tremble at the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ricardo</hi> hearing his Maſter talk ſo Idlely, began aſſuredly to think that all his

               <p>Sir <hi>Billy</hi> turning him on his ſide, as well as his bruiſed Body would give him leave; <hi>Friend Ricardo</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>thou ſpeakeſt as one ignorant in Arms, and therefore I ſhall the more bear with thee; Oh! if thoſe worthy Knights, Sir</hi> Huon <hi>of</hi> Bourdeaux, <hi>Sir</hi> Amadis de Gaule, <hi>Sir</hi> Palmendis, Palmerin <hi>of</hi> England, Palmerin Doliva, <hi>or thoſe other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Heroes mentioned in Books of Knight Errantry were now alive, how would they laugh at thy Ignorance, what wouldſt thou reap thy Harveſt before thou Soweſt thy Corn, gather thy Fruit before the Trees be grafted, drink the Wine e'er the Vine be planted? did not St.</hi> George <hi>ſuffer ſeven years impriſonment in a Dungeon in</hi> Perſia, <hi>before he came to be King of</hi> Morocco <hi>and</hi> Egypt; <hi>what troubles àid the Famous</hi> Chiron <hi>of</hi> England <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, before he obtained the Beautiful</hi> Caſſiopia <hi>in Marriage?

               </p>

                  <hi>But thoſe Men you ſpake of</hi> (ſaid <hi>Ricardo</hi>) <hi>ſpent their time in killing of Gyants, Monſters, and Tyrants; whereas all your Encounters have been only againſt Scare-Crows, Poppet-Shows, and Pedlárs, whereby you have received more Ignominy than Honour; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my reſolution is, that if henceforward you will not be rul'd from running your ſelf into needleſs dangers, miſtaking Inns for Caſtles, and Fairs for Armies, I ſhall reſign up my Squire-Errant-ſhip, and leave you alone to the purſuance of your Follies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Billy</hi> was ſo angry with <hi>Ricardo</hi> at theſe words, that could he have come at him, there had been a mortal affray between the Knight and his Squire; but his bruiſes and Sores would not admit him to ſtir. Now whilſt they were in this conſternation, came in the Conſtable, attended with Four or five ruſty Halberts, bringing with them a young luſty ſturdy Rogue, who being taken in a notorious Thievery, upon promiſe of Favour had confeſſed all that he knew concerning this Houſe, how it was the receptacle of their ſtolen Goods, and the randezvouze of them that ſtole them.</p>
               <p>Upon that information, the Conſtable made a ſtrict ſearch thorow all the Houſe, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing every one he found therein; But Sir <hi>Billy</hi> whoſe thoughts were holy taken up with what he had read in his Romantick Hiſtories; ſeeing the Conſtable and his Guard, cryed out, <hi>Oh ye haters and tormenters of Knights Errant, ye off-ſpring of</hi> Pluto <hi>and</hi> Cerebus, <hi>always envious of the good of Mankind, may miſchief and ſorrow go along with ye, may hearts diſcontent, and Sore affliction be play-fellows to keep you Company; may Poyſon be your drink, and Gall, nay worſe than Gall, the dainties that ye taſte. Think not ye wicked Negromancers, whoſe exerciſe is Murther and ſullen Tragedies, think not</hi> (I ſay) <hi>with all your Sorceries and Charms to prevail againſt me, who am ordained by
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:108980:30"/>the Fates to be a Scourge and plague to all ſuch wicked Miſcreants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words liſtned to attentively by the Conſtable, made him to wonder what kind of Perſon this ſhould be; and being told that he was a Knight Errant, <hi>I have heard</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>of Knights of</hi> the Garter, <hi>Knights of</hi> St. Michael, <hi>Knights of the</hi> Golden-Fleece, <hi>and ſeveral other ſorts of Knights, but never of</hi> Knights-Errant, <hi>and therefore I rather take him for a Knight-vagrant, and as a Vagrant I apprehend him, till I know fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from whence his Honour is derived.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Proud Magician</hi> (ſaid Sir <hi>Billy,</hi>) <hi>who knoweſt not what belongs to true Honour, think not to eſcape my hands without Chaſtiſement, Mangre the power of the</hi> Stygian <hi>Prince thy Hell-bred Master, and all his infernal band of Devils.</hi> The Conſtable hearing him rave in this manner, like a Bull ſtung by Hornets, or like one of <hi>Bacchus</hi> frantick raging Nuns, imagined him to be one who was ſcarce Maſter of his Wits, and therefore thought him to be an object of pitty rather than of puniſhment; but caſting his head aſide; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sir <hi>Billy</hi>'s Armor lie on a ſide Table, he thought them not things fitting for a Mad-Man to have in poſſeſſion, and therefore bid one of his followers to take and ſecure them.</p>
               <p>The Fellow no ſooner commanded but was getting them up on his Back to carry them away; which <hi>Ricardo</hi> eyeing, ſlipped on his <hi>Inviable-Ring,</hi> and following after him, no ſooner was he out of the Conſtable's ſight, but he ſtrikes up his heels, and giving him three or four buffets on the Face which almoſt dazel'd him, he takes the Armor and throws it into a by place all but his Sword, which he draws, and brandiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it about his head, runs towards the Conſtable, who ſeeing it come directly againſt him, threw down his Staff, and betook him to his heel; his followers ſeeing their Captain thus to run, and the Sword to come brandiſhing towards them, were alſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to run away from themſelves, like the Satyr that ran away at the Noiſe of the horn which he himſelf blew, and therefore caſting away their weapons, ran after him for Company. <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſeeing the Coaſt clear, went back again towards the fellow from whom he had took the Armor, who by this time was come again to himſelf, but ſeeing alſo a Sword without hands flaunting it towards him, he roared out like a Town-Bull, and taking example by others, thought his Legs the ſureſt defence, and ſo with haſty ſteps ran as it were from Death it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ricardo</hi> could not but ſmile to ſee how his project took, and taking off his <hi>Inviſible-Ring,</hi> returned to old <hi>Gerion</hi> the Beggar, who was as much amazed as the reſt, and would have ran likewiſe if he could have done it to any place of ſafety. But as for Sir <hi>Billy</hi> who beheld all what had happened, he was nothing daunted, but rather more confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in this Romantick opinions; being verily perſwaded that this help came from the wiſe <hi>

And therefore I am reſolved ſtill to follow my firſt reſolution in purſuance

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:108980:32"/>a great walking ſtaff, as commonly Beggars go ſo guarded, he gave one of the Rogues ſuch a rap on the pate as made him to ſtagger, and ſeconding it with another, laid him at his Feet ſtreaking his heels; the Third party ſeeing this, would have run for it, but being ſurrounded by them all four, he was forced to abide his fate, and whilſt he was defending himſelf againſt old <hi>Gerion</hi> and <hi>Ricardo,</hi> who faced him with their Weapons, Sir <hi>Billy</hi> being behind him, gave him ſuch a wound on the head as felled him to the earth, and ſent his Soul to dwell in the lower Regions, there to inhabit with the damned in burning Beds of Steel, Roaſted in Sulpher, and waſht in deep vaſt gulphs of Liquid Fire.</p>
               <p>The Smith in the mean time, through the loſs of ſo much Blood as iſſued from his Wound, was fallen into a deep ſwound, ſo that he ſeemed for the preſent to be inroled in the Regiment of Death, but his Companion who had been knockt down by old <hi>Gerion,</hi> being of a ſtrong robuſtious Nature, reviving again, began for to buſtle, as if he would again try for the Victory; which being perceived by Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> he ran to him, and with his Sword gave him ſuch a Blow on the head, as made him once more to meaſure his full length on the Earth, and then ſetting his Foot on his breaſt, and the point of his Sword to his Throat, he ſaid to him; <hi>Vile Miſcreant, or rather Devil in Hoſe and Doublet, the impoſtume of all corruptions, and abſtract of all wickedneſs; Now will I ſend thy Soul to be an inhabitant in the glooming dwellings of Damned Spirits, there to bathe it ſelf in pools of Scalding Oyl and Sulpher, which thou haſt worthily deſerved by contracting ſuch a Load of Guilt that lies heavy on thy blood-thirſty Conſcience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Murthering Villain hearing ſuch thundring Words, roared out like a Town Bull, craving and crying out for Mercy, when a new crotchet coming into Sir <hi>Billy's</hi> noddle, he ſaid unto him, I yield thee Mercy though unworthy of it, but upon condition that thou go and preſent thy ſelf upon thy knees as vanquiſhed by my Victorious Arm, unto the Lady of my Affections, the moſt renowned <hi>Dulcina of Billerecay,</hi> and this you ſhall Swear to do upon my Sword. I willingly yield to your conditions (ſaid the diſſembling Villain) and ſhall ſwear Faithfully to perform it. Whereupon Sir <hi>Billy</hi> let him riſe, and was about to give him his Oath, which the young Man perceiving, and that he intended to let him go; <hi>Sir</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>It is not ſafe nor convenient ſo to do, for this Man being a Murtherer, ought according to the Law to be had before a Juſtice of the Peace, to be by him examined and ſecured, that he may receive the reward of his deſerts.</hi> Sir <hi>Billy</hi> having heard what he ſaid, with a vehement indignation replyed, Thou ſpeakeſt <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> like one altogether ignorant of the Laws of Knight Errantry; ought not the Conquerer to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Conquered as he pleaſes? was not he ſubdued by the Force of my invincible Arm, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be by me diſpoſed of according to my own will and pleaſure; now ſince my valour whereby I conquered him came by the inſpiration of my Lady <hi>Dulcina,</hi> ought not ſhe in retribution thereof to have the honour of this ſubmiſſion, as being magnetically performed by her. But this <hi>(ſaid the Taylor)</hi> is ſo notorious a villain, and his crime ſo Capital, that being once got free, he will never come near her, nor ever make any ſubmiſſion unleſs he be forced to do it to the Gallows. Why, ſaid Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> have I not his Oath to perform it? His Oath, quoth the Taylor, is not to be regarded, for he who fears not to commit Murther, will make no Conſcience to forſwear himſelf.</p>
               <p>Whilſt they were thus arguing the Caſe, the Conſtable of the Pariſh, who had a Warrant for the preſſing of ſome Soldiers, being guarded with Four luſty men, came to that place, it being a Common receptacle for ſturdy loytering Beggars and Vagabonds; when beholding the floor imbrued with Blood, and ſtrowed with dead Carcaſes, he demanded the cauſe of this ſo ſad a Spectacle? to whom Sir <hi>Billy</hi> being about to reply, he was interrupted by the Taylor, who declared all the whole buſineſs in manner as you heard it before; and withal adding, that Sir <hi>Billy</hi> being a <hi>Knight-Errant,</hi> was reſolved to ſend that murdering Rogue that was alive to a certain Lady named <hi>Dulcina,</hi> but earneſtly deſired his Journey might be ſtaid, that the Hangman might not be diſappointed of his due.</p>
               <p>Yea, ſaid Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> I am by profeſſion a Knight Errant, my Trade is to kill Gyants and Dragons, and to relieve oppreſſed Ladies, and diſtreſſed Damoſels, to releaſe captivated Knights from their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, and to bring to confuſion the Helliſh brood of Negromancers and Inchanters. Sir (ſaid the Conſtable) if you are ſo good for fighting, you will be the fitter to ſerve the King, and therefore I preſs you for his Majeſty's ſervice. I underſtand (ſaid Sir <hi>Billy</hi>) that thou art a Conſtable, but altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in thy Office, for if thou hadſt read Books of Chevalry, thou wilt find that Knights Errant are ſubject to no King nor to no Laws. Sir (ſaid the Conſtable) if you are ſubject neither to King nor Laws, then you are a Vagabond, and as a Vagabond I muſt apprehend ye.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Billy</hi> hearing his Knighthood ſo vilified and degraded, was in a great rage, and drawing his Sword, he bid the Conſtable defend himſelf, for he ſhould dearly abide the Blaſphemy he had uttered againſt ſo Honourable an Order; and thereupon began to fall upon him with all his might. <hi>Ricardo</hi> and old <hi>Gerion</hi> ſeeing the madneſs of Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> ſtepped to him to have ſtaid his hands, but the more they ſtrived to hinder him, the more he laid on. The meſſenger that ſhould have gone to the Lady <hi>Dulcina,</hi> ſeeing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:108980:32"/>them thus to beſtir themſelves; betook himſelf unto his heels, which the Taylor perceiving, cryed out to follow him, whereupon they left off fighting, and ran after him, all but Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> who now was an abſolute Conqueror, at leaſt in conceit.</p>
               <p>The Smith who had all this while lain in a ſwound, his Soul now ſeemed to re-enter his Body, and he freed from this Counterfeit of death, roſe up, and ſtood upright on his Feet; and ſeeing Sir <hi>Billy</hi> with a wrathful countenance and a Sword in his hand, he fell on his knees, and humbly implored his Mercy. I grant you Life (ſaid Sir <hi>Billy</hi>) but upon Condition that as your fellow before you has engaged, you alſo preſent your ſelf on your knees, to my Lady <hi>Dulcina,</hi> as conquered by my Victorious Arm.</p>
               <p>By this time was the Conſtable returned bringing the fellow along with him, with his hands tyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him; and to prevent further miſchief, no ſooner was he in the Barn, but cloſing with Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> ſtruck up his heels, and diſarmed him of his Sword, whilſt the others ſeized on the Smith. The Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable would alſo have tyed Sir <hi>Billy's</hi> hands had not <hi>Ricardo</hi> and old <hi>Gerion</hi> interceded for him; However Sir <hi>Billy</hi> rav'd like a mad Man for the Loſs of his Sword, threatning the Conſtable, whom he branded with the Name of Magician, Sorcerer, Negromancer, and a hundred ſuch other names as he had read in Books of Knight Errantry. The Conſtable taking him for one whoſe brains were crazed, gave little regaad unto his words, but told him he ſhould have his Sword; Only in the mean time he muſt go before one of his profeſſion, a righter of wrongs, a reliever of the oppreſſed, and who by vertue of a piece of Paper can ſend a Man to an Inchanted Caſtle, kept by furious Gyants, ſo ſtrong and unpreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that none can deliver him out of it, but he that is armed with the Sword of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Shew me one of thoſe Inchanted Caſtles (ſaid Sir <hi>Billy</hi>) and if I do not take it by my Valour, and the ſtrength of my unconquered Arm, Then let my Name be for ever razed out of the Honourable Bead-role of Knights Errant, and I eſteemed for a Carpet Knight, a meer Toaſt and Butter, afraid of my own Sword, and affrighted with the claſhing of my own Armor.</p>
               <p>The Conſtable hearing Sir <hi>Billy</hi>'s reſolution, could not chuſe but ſmile, telling him he would help him to the fight of this Inchanted Caſtle, and now all parties being ready, laying the two dead Bodies upon Sir <hi>Billy</hi>'s and <hi>Ricardo</hi>'s Horſes, and the two Priſoners pinioned and guarded by the Conſtables attendants, they ſet forwards towards a Juſtice of the Peace his Houſe, where how they ſped you ſhall hear in the Chapter following.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 14.</hi> Sir <hi>Billy</hi>'s entertainment at the Juſtices Houſe, his Oration in praiſe of the Golden Age, with his challenging the Coroner to fight in defence of Knight-Errantry.</head>
               <p>THIS Juſtice that they were going to was a very merry conceited Gentleman, which made the Conſtable the more willing to have Sir <hi>Billy</hi> to him; and by the way to ſooth him up in his Fancies, he told him that the Lord of the Caſtle whether they were going, was deſcended in a direct Line by the Fathers ſide from the Famous <hi>Montelion Knight of the Oracle,</hi> and by the Mothers ſide from the Renowned <hi>Amadis de Gaul;</hi> That all the brave Heroes mentioned in the <hi>Mirror of Knighthood</hi> were near of Kin to his Anceſtors, as alſo that <hi>Don Belianis of Greece, Pariſmus,</hi> and <hi>Pheander the Maiden Knight,</hi> were his great Grandfathers firſt Couzens. <hi>Ricardo</hi> heard all their diſcourſe, with great attention, and hearing him nominate only foreign kindred, he asked the Conſtable how it came to paſs that his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors marched into ſuch remote parts, and not rather into their own Country, and if they did, what Kin this Lord of the Caſtle was to <hi>Guy Earl of Warwick,</hi> or <hi>Bevis of Southampton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have heard (ſaid the Conſtable) by Tradition, and they ſay it is recorded in the Chronicles of <hi>Miconi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> that Earl <hi>Terry</hi> who was ſiſters Son to <hi>Guy,</hi> was Nephew to <hi>Euphroſina</hi> this Lord of the Caſtle's great Grandfathers Aunt, and that <hi>Sabere</hi> Sir <hi>Bevis</hi> his Uncle was Nephew in two deſcents to Earl <hi>Terry.</hi> Thou ſpeakeſt (ſaid Sir <hi>Billy</hi>) as one well verſed in the ſtudy of Knight Errantry, and indeed it hath been often in my own thoughts, that I am deſcended from <hi>Valentine</hi> or <hi>Orſon, Don Flores of Greece, Palmerin of England,</hi> or ſome of thoſe renowned Champions whoſe Names flouriſh in the Book of Fame, becauſe I feel in my ſelf thoſe ſparks of Fire kindled in my breaſt, which do ſtir up noble minds to vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant performances.</p>
               <p>By this time they were come to the Juſtices Houſe, where before they were examined, the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acquainted him with the humor of Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> and what diſcourſe he had had with him, which pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Fancy extraordinarily; but having a great reſpect to Juſtice, he firſt ſifted out the Buſineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the two dead Corps which were brought before him, and upon examination ſent the Smith and his partner to Priſon, retaining Sir <hi>Billy</hi> ſtill with him, and uſing ſuch reſpect to him as he thought was moſt correſpondent to a Knight Errant.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Billy</hi> whilſt the Juſtice was examining the Priſoners, buſied himſelf with viewing ſome old Helmets,

                  </gap> than the beſt Tapiſtry that could adorn it. And now the Company being gone, Sir <hi>Billy</hi> was invited to a Banquet of ſeveral diſhes ſuitable to the ſeaſon; but e'er he would ſit down to participate of it, he began a long Oration in praiſe of Frugality, to uſher in the great need of Knight Errantry, which with an audible voice he delivered in theſe words.</p>
               <p>Thrice happy was that time which men do call the <hi>Golden Age,</hi> not becauſe Gold was then plenty, but for the Innocent and harmleſs lives of thoſe that lived in it: being contented with thoſe things which Nature produced of it ſelf; Their Meat was the Roots of the Earth, Nuts and Acorns, dainty Fare; and for Liquors, they had recourſe to the Chriſtal Spring; the Earth brought forth Roſes and flowers of it ſelf, without the Midwifry of Gardeners, and the common wealth of Bees inſtead of ſtings carried Honey in their Tails. Thoſe contentious words of <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> were not known in the World. Men contented themſelves with Cloaths made of the Fleece as it came from the Sheep, which they wore only for Warmth, for Pride was then a ſtranger on the Earth. The Lambs fed ſecurely by the Lyons ſide, and Warm <hi>Zephyrus</hi> breathed forth a continual Spring. In thoſe days there was no bandying of War Nation againſt Nation, nor did men dare in a thin ribb'd Bark to croſs the Ocean for uncertain gain. There was no need of threatning Laws to be preſcribed in Braſs, for men knew not what it was to offend. Juſtice was then blind indeed, and could not ſee to take any bribes. There was no need of <hi>Italian Padlocks,</hi> for Luſt then was a vice unknown. But after corruptions began to increaſe, that bribes and Rapes were ripe in every place, when the ſtronger ſought to oppreſs the weaker, and great Thieves ſat on the Bench to condemn the little ones; when Ladies innocency could not defend their chaſtity from the aſſaults of wicked and viceous Men; when vice came thus to predominate, then was this Valiant and chaſt order of Knight Errantry invented, whoſe office it is to relieve the oppreſſed, vindicate Ladies, help Orphans, reſcue thoſe who are in Priſon, and pull the pride of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants down; and of this noble order am I, which howſoever maligned and oppoſed by wicked Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Sorcerers, yet is there no Order, Calling, nor profeſſion in the World, ſo neceſſary to humane kind as this; And though I deſire not to be the Trumpeter of my own praiſe, what I have performed herein, (beſides the witneſs of my Squire <hi>Ricardo,</hi> the Author of my Hiſtory, for every Knight Errant hath an Hiſtorian to declare his Acts) will in after-ages make known the Noble performances which have been atchieved by me.</p>
               <p>The whole Company applauded Sir <hi>Billy's</hi> ſpeech, and ſaid, it was great pitty ſo neceſſary an Order of Knighthood ſhould remain dormant ſo long, and how happy the ſucceeding age would be, that ſhould read with wonder the noble Atchievements performed by his Victorious Arm. Which words puffed up Sir <hi>Billy</hi> with ſuch a timpany of pride, that like the Bladder he was ready to burſt with the Wind of vain Glory. And now being tickled with the undeſerved praiſe, he willing to ſit down with them at the Banquet, where he could ſcarcely feed himſelf for feeding the Ears of his Auditors with diſcourſes of his Adventures, in the mean time the Juſtice ſent for the Coroner to come with all the ſpeed he could, for ſear Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> who was a main witneſs in the buſineſs, might have a magget in his Head to be gone, and therefore the better to retain him, he ſpake to him in theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſt Renowned Knight, who though but young in Years, yet art Old in Fame and experience of Arms, whoſe deſert out-strips all praiſe I can bestow upon thee; Had the divine</hi> Homer, <hi>one of the Muſes firſt Prieſts, been Contemporary with thee, how proud he would have been of ſo ſublime a ſubject to heighten his Fancy; a ſubject ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to</hi> Apollo <hi>himſelf, and his whole Quire of Daughters. How benign muſt I eſteem thoſe Stars whoſe influence directed thy Foot-ſteps to my Habitation, hoping that as</hi> Ulyſſes <hi>communicated his Travels and Adventures to Queen</hi> Dido, <hi>ſo from his own mouth they ſhould receive a relation of thoſe noble Atchievements performed by him, whereof Fame had been ſo liberal in publiſhing of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Billy</hi> needed no ſpur to be put forward in ſuch matters, his Tongue was ever ready to run Poſt in any thing which he thought tended to his own praiſe, and therefore without any more intreaty he began a long diſcourſe of his entrance into Knight Errantry, how he became enamour'd on a moſt Beautiful Lady named <hi>Dulcina;</hi> his entertaining <hi>Ricardo</hi> to be his Squire, and of their firſt encounter with a tall Gyant in a Corn-Field, whom he overthrew by main ſtrength of Arms; how he was Knighted by the Lord of a Caſtle, and how in relieving of a certain Queen, he encountered with another mighty Gyant, in which by the envy of certain wicked Magicians he fell into a deep Cave, from which he was delivered by the Sage <hi>Freſton;</hi> and ſo ran on in a rambling narration of all his Adventures, as you heard in the foregoing Hiſtory; but ſtill imputing all his misfortunes to the malice of Megromancers and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters, who are always enemies to Knights Errant. <hi>Yet ſhall not their malice</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>deter me from proſecuting my revengs againſt thoſe wicked Miſcreants, Gyants and Sorcerers, till I have rooted out the whole Generation of them from off the face of the Earth.</hi>

Sir <hi>Billy</hi> had never ſeen any of theſe Legerdemain Tricks before, and therefore his Spirits were ſtruck into admiration, and his Soul intrance't with wonder. <hi>Ricardo</hi> all this while ſtood by, and ſeeing his Maſter ſtruck into ſuch an aſtoniſhment, thought to make ſome ſport, as well as the Jugler, and ſlipping on his <hi>Inviſible Ring,</hi> when <hi>Hocus</hi> had laid his Tin Boxes and Balls on the Table, and was feeling in his pocket for ſome other Inſtruments of activity, he takes them up and puts them in his pocket: <hi>Hocus</hi> ſeeing his Boxes and Balls <hi>Hi Preſto</hi> to be gone, was more amazed than Sir <hi>Billy</hi> was at his Tricks; but thinking ſome of the Company might do it to make themſelves merry, and loth to challenge any in particular, he thought to catch them by craft, and therefore pulling out a <hi>Jack in a Box,</hi> ſome Counters and Dice to do more feats withall, he lays them as it were careleſly upon the Table, yet ſtill had a ſpecial eye who took them. <hi>Ricardo</hi> thought what was his drift, yet dreading not his policy, boldly ſteps to the Table and quickly made them Inviſible. The Jugler ſeeing the reſt of his things to be gone thus without hands, ſtood like one that was ſtupified, or like Stags at a gaze, as if his underſtanding were in an extaſie. At laſt he ſwore there was ſome Conjurer amongſt them, whoſe art was far tranſcendent above his, for he did but play the Devil in Jeſt, but they had plaid the Devil with him in Earneſt. At this the whole Company burſt out into ſuch a laughter as if they had for ever baniſht all melancholly from their Society. This exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mirth made <hi>Hocus</hi> more vext then before, ſo that he began to ſwear like a Culter, for having now loſt his Tools, he might even ſhut up Shop for any thing he could do.</p>
               <p>And now a new project of mirth came into the noddle of one of the Company, who perſwaded the Jugler that Sir <hi>Billy</hi> had taken away his things, and that to get them again, there was no way but uſing him roughly, which he ſhould not need fear to do, becauſe Sir <hi>Billy</hi> what ever he bragged himſelf to be, was but a meer Hony-ſop, a diſh of skim'd Milk, whoſe Feet was his beſt defence, and his Tongue his beſt Weapon. The Jugler animated herewith, ſteps to Sir <hi>Billy</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Sir, I underſtand you have gotten my things, and therefore pray give me them again without any more Fooling; which if you refuſe to do, I ſhall make you ſuch an Example of my wroth and Indignation, as ſhall make you curſe the time that ever you ſaw me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Billy</hi> hearing ſuch threatning words from one he thought ſo much beneath him in great anger replyed; <hi>Thou wicked Inchanter, unworthy to live upon the Face of the Earth, who haſt made a league with Hell, and a Covenant with the Devil to be his Servant; Think not by thy wicked Charms to eſcape my fury, for if thou hadſt as many hands as</hi> Briareus, <hi>and in every hand there were a Sword, yet would I encounter with thee, my Valour being ſuch, as to know no fear in my ſelf, yet to teach it others that have to do with me.</hi> And thereupon drawing his Sword began to lay on load upon <hi>Hocus,</hi> who ſeeing Sir <hi>Billy</hi> was in earneſt, thought his beſt refuge to be his Heels, running with ſuch haſty ſteps as if his feet ſcarce toucht the Ground, being more ſwift in his flight than <hi>Daphne</hi> when ſhe fled from the imbraces of <hi>Apollo;</hi> whereupon the Company gave ſuch a ſhout as made the Houſe to Ring; their loud exclamations cleaving the yielding Air, like the roaring of a whole Herd of Lyons, <hi>(or if it could be)</hi> greater than the Noiſe of Ten Iriſh Funerals.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Billy</hi> ſeeing his flight ſo ſwift, thought it in vain to purſue him any further, and thereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in as great State as the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Victor from the Conqueſt of <hi>Darius.</hi> The Juſtice meeting him congratulated his ſucceſs, giving him as much praiſe as if it had been the thirteenth labour of <hi>Alcides;</hi> the other perſons alſo each one in proper words ſought to magnifie this his enterprize, although an attempt ſo inconſiderable, that had the Jugler had but as much valour as an <hi>Hamble-Bee,</hi> with a dozen of dangerous words in his mouth, he might have reſiſted him with a Bull-Ruſh.</p>
               <p>By this time the Coroner was come to the Houſe, and a Jury impannelled to enquire about the two dead Perſons; The firſt witneſs that was examined was Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> who being requeſted to tell his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the particulars, ſpake as followeth.</p>
               <p>You ſhall know Courteous Gentleman, that by profeſſion I am a Knight Errant, an Order of all others the moſt beneficial to mankind, which were it highly cheriſhed as it is deſerving, it would encourage many noble Spirits to the profeſſion thereof, by whoſe manly proweſs all Tyrants and oppreſſors of the Poor being ſuppreſſed, we ſhould have no need of Lawyers, Attorneys, nor Soliciters, who pretending to right people in their cauſes, do them more wrong by their extortions and Fees, than they received by the parties againſt whom they ſued. In the proſecution of theſe Knightly adventures, it was my Fortune or rather lucky Chance to come to an old ruinated Caſtle, attended only by my Squire <hi>Ricardo,</hi> and an
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:108980:34"/>Old Gentleman, one of the <hi>Knights of Induſtry;</hi> Into this ſolitary Receptacle being entered to ſharde us from the burning beams of the refulgent Sun, we eſpyed there a moſt ſad and dolorn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Woman hanged, and a Man hanging, with little hopes of Life in either; which we had ſcarce leiſure to view, when a luſty ſtout robuſtious fellow ruſhed from forth the place, and winged with haſt, ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as ſwift as the ſweeping ſtream or winged Arrow. He being gone, we cut the young Man down, who was near entred into the territories of Death, yet by helps that was uſed, he was brought again to the poſſeſſion of Life, as you ſee there ſtanding before ye, but the Woman, who was the Lady of his Affections, notwithſtading all endeavours which we uſed, we could never perſwade her ſullen Soul for to re-enter into her Body, but Lifes Candle was quite extinct in her.</p>
               <p>Whilſt we were thus fruitleſly employed in the recovery of the Maid, the murdering Villain who had ran from us before, now returned again with two others who had been partners with him in his Butcherly deſign, and ſetting upon us, thought to have made us a morſel for the Jaws of Death, and with their Clubs have ſigned our Paſsport into another World, but I perceiving what was their intentions, drawing my Sword, and invocating the Lady <hi>Dulcina</hi> for aid, ſet upon the Villains, and in an inſtant brought two of them to the Ground, of which Death, the Graves Purveyor, took poſſeſſion of one, the othes ſoon after recovered, whom we brought unto you, as alſo the third, who though he ran away from me, yet was brought back again by my Squire <hi>Ricardo</hi> and the <hi>Knight of Induſtry,</hi> with ſome others who came into our aſſiſtance, although had I been alone, the ſtrength of my Victorious Arm had been enough to have Conquered them all.</p>
               <p>The whole Company highly applauded Sir <hi>Billy</hi>'s valour, as a true Son of <hi>Mars,</hi> that derides Death, and meets with Triumph in a Tomb. Afterwards was the Taylor examined, as alſo old <hi>Gerion,</hi> and <hi>Ricardo,</hi> who agreeing all in one Tale, the Jury found the Maids to be wilful Murther, and the killing of the Fellow done in their own defence.</p>
               <p>The Juſtice being a bountiful Houſekeeper, invited the Coroner and Jury, as alſo Sir <hi>Billy, Ricardo,</hi> and old <hi>Gerion</hi> to Dinner, which he had cauſed to be provided for them againſt they had done. After Dinner the Juſtice and Coroner fell into a deep diſcourſe, the Coroner being of Opinion, that the Order of Knights Errant was a needleſs, Idle, unneceſſary imployment, for that the Laws being ſo open, wrongs might be redreſſed, and the oppreſſed eaſed far better by the Law, than by their Swords, which oftentimes for want of due knowledge of the caſe, did far greater wrong than right: And as for Books of Chevalry, he Judged them to be very prejudicial to a well-governed Common-Wealth, wherein Men might beſtow their time better than in reading Figments, impoſſibilities, and in many of them incitements rather to looſeneſs and Vanity, than any inſtructions to vertuous Living. To this the Juſtice replyed, that Knights Errant have in former Ages been applauded by learned Perſons, for ſuch was <hi>Hercules,</hi> whoſe going about and deſtroying Gyants and Monſters, was no other than Knight-Errantry, and for which they honoured him as a God; and then for reading Books of Chevalry, what prejudice could come by reading them? for the ſubjects of them being known to be fabulous and fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, no man's faith is beguiled, nor any perſwaded to believe them as a truth; rather on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, where the minds of the vulgar are not buſied in ſome ſuch pleaſant arguments, they fall upon matters which leſs concerns them, and become troubleſome Judges of the State and Church wherein they live, and therefore it hath been accounted great Policy to divert Men's Fancies by reading ſuch Romances.</p>
               <p>Many other ways might be invented <hi>(ſaid the Coroner)</hi> to divert Mens Fancies, than this deſtructive one of rending ſuch Books, which the better they are Writ, the more dangerous they are, for ſome young people are ſo intentive upon them, that they imagine themſelves to be ſuch as they read of; And ſuch a one I ſuppoſe this young man to be, who by reading Books of Knight Errantry, would Fool himſelf into a conceit that he is a Knight Errant. But ſuch people ſo conceired ought not to be ſoothed up in their Follies, but rather ſharply reproved, and if that will not mend them, then either let them be ſent to <hi>Bedlam,</hi> or Whipped at a Carts-Tayle, until this fooliſh humour be Whipped out of them.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Billy</hi> was in ſuch a rage to hear theſe words, that the Icy Current of his frozen blood kindled up in agonies as hot as flames of burning Sulphur, fretting and ſuming like a piece of Gumm'd Velvet. Monſter of all wicked Men <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> whom I cannot name without ſpitting after it for fear of being poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned; could thy malice vent it ſelf in nothing but ſpeaking againſt the moſt noble Order of Knight-Errantry? nor know I whether thy envy or arrogancy be greateſt in it, nor what puniſhment is equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to ſuch high preſumption; yet ſhall not thy malapertneſs eſcape unpuniſhed if my truſty Sword fail me not, and therefore if thou art as valiant of thy hands as thou haſt been prodigal of thy Tongue, I challenge thee out into the field to fight with me; which if thou ſhalt deny to do, I ſhall proclaim
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108980:34"/>thee the moſt Cowardly Carpet Knight that ever wore Sword, only valiant in Voice, but at the ſight of an Enemy ready to run away from thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>The Coroner who was a man well skill'd at his Weapon, and with Courage anſwerable to his skill, ſcorning to be out-braved by ſuch a Princocks, was reſolved to chaſtiſe his folly, and therefore told him, that though it were beneath him to anſwer one ſo Inconſiderable, yet leaſt his raſhneſs ſhould take that to be fear which was only contempt, he would anſwer him at any time, place, or weapon he ſhould appoint; bidding him be ſure in making his words good of what he had promiſed, or elſe he would be a ſhame unto the Order he did profeſs.</p>
               <p>And I quoth <hi>Ricardo,</hi> Squire unto the renowned Knight Sir <hi>Billy</hi> of <hi>Billerecay,</hi> do challenge the Squire that belongeth to the Knight which is to fight with my maſter, at any Weapon he ſhall propoſe to fight withal, ſo it be ſuch a Weapon as former Squires to Knights-Errant uſed for to fight withal. This unexpected Challenge of <hi>Ricardo</hi> put all the Company into a merry kind of amazement, endeavouring by all means to have the humor go forward. There was at that time attending on the Coroner a young Man much about the Age and ſtature of <hi>Ricardo,</hi> who hearing this Challenge, deſired his Maſter he might accept of it, which being granted him, he told <hi>Ricardo</hi> he ſhould be anſwered at his own Weapon, at the time and place when their Maſters did fight. All things being thus agreed, they next conſult of the time and place when, and where it ſhould be done; Sir <hi>Billy</hi> would have had a ſortnights ſpace, and that in the mean time Meſſengers ſhould be ſent abroad to declare by ſound of Trumpet in all Market-Towns and general aſſemblies of this their fight; But the Juſtice and Coroner not willing to have a private divertiſement made ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, would not agree to it; ſo at laſt it was concluded to be the ſecond day after, in a large Meadow behind the Juſtices Houſe, during which time the four Combatants prepared themſelves for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, which how it was performed on both ſides, we ſhall in the next Chapter (the ſacred nine aſſiſting in our endeavours) in full and ample manner declare unto you.</p>

                  </gap> that if he overcame him he ſhould be her Knight, and that ſhe ſhould account her ſelf the moſt happy Woman in the World to have ſuch a Servant.</p>
               <p>I think my ſelf extraordinarily engaged to you for your goodneſs, ſaid Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> and doubt not Madam of my ſucceſs, it being in the vindication of thoſe noble Knights, <hi>Amadis de Gaule, Sir Huon of Bourdeaux, Don Belianis of Greece, Palmerin of England, Orlando Furioſo, Don Flores of Greece, Sir Guy of Warwick, Bevis of Southampton,</hi> and abundance of other noble Heroes, who ſpending their time in Arms, dyed in the Bed of Honour, whoſe memory this foul Miſcreant ſeeks to deprave, and that with ſuch opprobrious words, enough to raiſe the Ghoſt of thoſe deceaſed Worthies out of their Graves, to vindicate their own Honour, had not the Fates allotted me in this latter Age to be a Brother of that noble Society, for the puniſhment of all thoſe who ſhall offer to villifie ſuch a noble, profitable, Honourable Order.</p>
               <p>You have reaſon in what you ſay, (replyed the Damoſel,) for ſhould ſuch noble Orders fall into contempt, it would be a great diſcouragement to vertuous enterprizes, and then for want of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons how would the World be peſter'd with Tyrants, Oppreſſors, and mercileſs perſons, Dragons and Monſters would abound in every place, and Gyants ſo increaſe, that the habitable World would be turned into a meer Deſart.</p>
               <p>Whilſt they were thus diſcourſing, there came a Meſſenger to Sir <hi>Billy</hi> to bid him make ready for the encounter, for his Antagoniſt was upon entering the Liſts; whereupon Sir <hi>Billy</hi> buckled on his Armor, which was ſomething difficult for him to do, each piece being ſo ill proportioned to the other; and now thus Armed, as he thought <hi>Cap-pe,</hi> he marched into the field againſt his Enemy, who was attending him, clad in a Buff Coat, with no other Armor but his Sword. <hi>Ricardo</hi> and the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:108980:35"/>other young man came into the field, habited for to fight, and with a reſolution anſwerable to the Courage of their Maſters. And now a general expectation was fixed in the minds of the Spectuors, each promiſing to themſelves an aſſured Victory. but the Eyes of moſt there preſent were fully fixed on Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> who marched in as great ſtate towards the Coroner as <hi>Hector</hi> the <hi>Trojan</hi> Prince before the Walls of <hi>Ilium,</hi> and being come near to him, he ſaid, yield thy ſelf Priſoner to my conquering Arm, elſe ſhall thy Life pay for thy Tongues preſumption. I crave no favour, ſaid the Coroner, but look to thy ſelf, elſe will the Honour of Knight Errantry lie in the duſt; and thereupon they began to lay on at each other, Sir <hi>Billy</hi> with much ſtrength and fury, the Coroner with Courage Joyned with skill, by which he ſo much o're-matched our young Knight Errant, that notwithſtanding he earneſtly invocated his Lady <hi>Dulcina,</hi> and implored the aſſiſtance of the whole <hi>Mirror of Knighthood,</hi> the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſo beſtirred him, that putting by the thruſt of his Sword, he cloſed within him, and ſtrikeing up his heels, took his Sword from him, telling him he was not fitting to wear any ſuch Weapon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out he knew how to handle it better.</p>
               <p>This Combat gave more cauſe of laughter than admiration, Sir <hi>Billy</hi> having promiſed ſo much and performed ſo little. In the mean time <hi>Ricardo</hi> and the Coroners Man began a more mirthful Combat between them; for <hi>Ricardo</hi> by vertue of his <hi>Inviſible-Ring</hi> feared not any danger he ſhould be expoſed unto, which made him ſo forward to challenge the other. With much Courage and reſolution theſe two Petty-Toes of <hi>Mars</hi> did fight it out for a while, but when <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſaw his Maſter lie at the mercy of the Conqueror, and himſelf hard beſted, he thought it was high time for him to fly to his old ſhifts, and therefore skipping about in antick manner to make the people laugh, and counterfeiting a flight, he ſlipped on his <hi>Inviſible-Ring,</hi> and then returning with great confidence, laid on load upon the Coroner, who feeling the blows, and not ſeeing the hand that gave him them, was ſtruck into ſuch a Panick fear, that he ran away as ſwift as the Eaſtern wind, or ſhafts ſhot from a <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Bow. <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſeeing his flight too ſwift for him to overtake, turned to the other, and as one that had all his thoughts bound up in Choller, he laid on load with might and main; The young man ſeeing how his Maſter had run for it before, thought it was in vain for him to ſtay behind, eſpecially when blows came ſo thick and faſt, and therefore betook himſelf to his heels; <hi>Ricardo</hi> following him, ſometimes ſtrikeing him on the Back, and ſometimes tripping up his heels, making him tumble over and over, which cauſed a great laughter in the people, to ſee the Maſter and Man after they had obtained the Victory, to run away as they thought from their own Shadows. Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> who lay fretting vexed with this diſgrace, ſeeing them both run away, preſently an imagination came into his head, how the Sage <hi>Freſton</hi> had ſent him relief, and therefore riſing, and taking up his Sword which the Coroner for haſt had dropped as he ran, he flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed it about his Head, ſaying, Come all ye Miſcreants, Foes to Knight Errantry, come I ſay and ſee how the Fates Favours thoſe who are followers of this noble Order, againſt whom no ſtrength of Arms nor Magical Charms is able to prevail, having always ſome to ſuccour them in their greateſt diſtreſs; And thou Sage <hi>Freston,</hi> how am I bound to thee for thy ſpecial aid in all my neceſſities, how would this Vile Monſter have Domineer'd had he prevailed over me; how would the Honour of Knight Errantry have been depreſt, had I miſcarried in this Action; How will after-Ages read the Hiſtory that ſhall be written of me with admiration, what perils I have endured for the Honour of Knight Errantry. Whilſt he was thus Vaunting, the Coroner who had by this time run himſelf out of breath, feeling no more blows, nor ſeeing any one; aſhamed of himſelf for this Cowardiſe, he returned back again towards Sir <hi>Billy</hi> with more fury and indignation than before, and laying about him as furiouſly as <hi>Achilles</hi> on the flying <hi>Trojans,</hi> he had given Sir <hi>Billy</hi> a total overthrow, had not <hi>Ricardo,</hi> ſeeing his Maſter in ſuch danger, left following the young Man, and come to his reſcue, and ſeeing it was no time to delay, he laid upon the Coroner, giving blows as thick and faſt as when he threſhed Corn before he turned Squire Errant. The Coroner feeling the ſmart of the blows, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing by which he received them, was ſtruck with a deep amazement, like a Man gone a far Journey from himſelf, or like unto Priſoners when they felt themſelves turned into Beaſts, ſo that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of running from his Enemy, he was ready to run away from himſelf. Sir <hi>Billy</hi> who was always more valiant of his Tongue than his hands, ſeeing the Coroner ſtand ſtruck with aſtoniſhment, as if he had lookt on the <hi>Gorgons</hi> Face, began to bruſtle up himſelf, ſpeaking ſuch Gigantick words, that if his deeds were to be meaſured by them, each one that heard him would have taken him for a Man of Valour But Sir <hi>Billy</hi> was one of them who could ſpeak much and do but little, for the Coroner exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated at his words, ran upon him, and by main ſtrength overthrew him, and doubtleſs had kill'd him on the place, had not <hi>Ricardo</hi> alſo run upon him, and tumbling him over Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> by that means gave his Maſter leave to riſe again. The Company ſeeing them thus in earneſt, fearing it would grow to more miſchief than was intended, reſolved to part them, which <hi>Ricardo</hi> perceiving, he left the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:108980:35"/>two Combatants, and getting out of ſight, pulled off his <hi>Inviſible-Ring,</hi> and returned back, limping all the way as one wounded in the encounter. This bred more wonder in the Company than any thing that had paſſed before, how <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſhould come to be hurt, ſeeing, to their thinking, he ran away before he received any Wound, or the leaſt matter that ſhould cauſe him to hault.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ricardo,</hi> e're he came at them, began to exclaim on this manner. Accurſed place, that ever valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Knight Errant, or faithful Squire, ſhould come into it, ſurely the <hi>Stygian</hi> Prince, that general Adverſary of human Nature, haunts this place, who by his wicked Emiſſaries hath ſo belaboured me, as if he intended to make Mummy of my fleſh; but could I but ſee this black Prince of <hi>Acheron,</hi> or any of thoſe his infernal Meſſengers which thus carried me out of the fight, he ſhould ſee I would not fear to encounter with him; but thus to beat and miſuſe Men unſeen, is both Cowardly and baſe, and quite contrary to the Rules of Knight Errantry.</p>
               <p>The Coroner and his Man hearing <hi>Ricardo</hi>'s diſcourſe, declared how they were alſo ſerved, ſhewing ſeveral Cuts and gaſhes of a Sword on their Clothes, with ſome ſlight hurts on their Bodies, proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it could be no other than a Spirit. This made them all amazed but only Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> who would needs perſwade them it was a puniſhment inflicted on them by the Sage <hi>Freſton,</hi>

               <p>But <hi>(replied the old Juſtice)</hi> how comes it to paſs that <hi>Ricardo,</hi> who is at leaſt a retainer to Knight Errantry, ſhould alſo be puniſhed by him, as well as theſe who are profeſſed Enemies of that Order? That is deſervedly inflicted on him (replied Sir <hi>Billy</hi>) becauſe not many days before I came hither, his fooliſh Tongue was venting ſome ſpeeches derogatory to that noble profeſſion; Nay, ſo far did his folly prevail with him, that he would have perſwaded me to have left off purſuing of Knightly Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to have ſpent the remainder of my days in Eaſe and Idleneſs, had I not been endowed with a heart betwixt whom and fear there's an antipathy, my known diſpoſition being ſuch, as to ſcorn thoſe dangers which would make a Coward tremble to think on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ricardo</hi> had much a do to forbear laughing out-right, to hear his Maſter talk ſo rediculouſly, as alſo to think how he had poſſeſt the Coroner and his Man with a firm belief that they were beaten by Spirits, but by this means all thoughts of fighting any more being quite laid aſide, the Juſtice invited them all unto his Houſe, and that there might be a thorough reconciliation betwixt them, the Coroner led Sir <hi>Billy</hi> by the hand, and his Man the Squire <hi>Ricardo.</hi> Here did the Juſtice expreſs his bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful nature by the great entertainment he gave them, which was ſuch, as if <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Baochus</hi> had taken up his Houſe for their habitation. The Juſtices Daughter, who had before ſo graced Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> being extreamly taken with his extravagancies, to follow on the humour, entertained him in theſe Words.</p>
               <p>Moſt noble Knight, whoſe proweſs is far above my expreſſions, blind Fortunes Mincion in Valorous attempts, having a Spirit of greater confidence than can give admittance to any thoughts of Cowardiſe; more welcome is thy preſence to me, than that of <hi>

               <p>Indeed (ſaid Sir <hi>Billy</hi>) the Goddeſs of my affections is ſuch a one, that ſhould I go about to deſcribe her, I muſt uſe the help of the moſt precious things, and invocate the learnedeſt of the Nine Muſes for my aſſiſtance. Her Hair, that Amorous Cordage, like to a rich and artful Coronet, ſhews like to Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains for Beauties Chamber. Her Forehead, Beauties Sphear, ſhews like to a Mount of bleached Snow. built upon two Ivory Arches. Her Eyes thoſe ſtarry Jewels, ſuch as might Captivate Love, and her Eye-brows enough to Work miracles with their Magick Circles. Her Cheeks like two banks of faireſt Flowers enrich't with ſweetneſs, like mingled Baths of Milk and Roſes. Her Ears thoſe watchful Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, need no Jewels to Adorn them, her Ears themſelves being all Jewels. Her Noſe ſuch where <hi>Zephyrus</hi> delights to ſport. Her Lips are melting Rubies, where Love plants and gathers Kiſſes. Her Teeth like Ivory pales, which incloſe a Tongue made up of ſweeteſt Hony. Her Breath comes ſtealingly from her, as if it ſeemed loth to come forth from ſo delicious a Manſion, but that it hoped to be drawn in again to that well cloſed Paradiſe. Her Neck ſhews like a Silver Pillar, more white than Towers of polliſht Ivory. Her Breaſts, thoſe Twins of Miracle, are like two Hillocks betwixt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>This deſcription of his Miſtreſs ſtruck the Juſtice's Daughter into amazement, as taking her to be a piece whom Nature in the Compoſing had taken the choiceſt excellencies from divers others to make one every ways compleat; but knowing Lovers are partial in the deſcription of their Miſtreſſes excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies; that ſhe might be the better informed, finding <hi>Ricardo</hi> alone, and in a merry humor, ſhe deſired him to inform her fully in the accompliſhments of his Maſters ſo celebrated Lady.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ricardo,</hi> who was almoſt weary of his Squire Errantry, and perceiving that his hopes of being Governour of an Iſland would not amount to be Monarch of a Mole Hill; and that all his Maſters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and deſigns were but meer <hi>Chymera</hi>'s and Idle imaginations; was reſolved therefore to leave off this kind of Vagabonding Life, and if his Maſter would not be perſwaded to go home, to leave him in purſuance of his folly; being therefore fearleſs of his diſpleaſure, he thought to give the Gentlewoman a more Comical but truer deſcription of this Lady of perfections, which he performed in this manner.</p>
               <p>To begin with her upper parts, Her hair (ſaid he) hangs down her neck like crawling Snakes, curiouſly pleated into Elf-Locks. Her Forehead like a piece of new-furrowed Land, or like the parched Earth in the heat of <hi>Dog-days.</hi> Her Eyes like two Mill-pits continually running over, on either ſide of which hangs two Souſes or Ears, of ſuch a prodigious greatneſs, that were they cut off and Tann'd, would ſerve a Cobler a Month for Clouting Leather. Her Cheeks are like two ſhrimpled skins of parchment, and her Noſe comparable to that in the picture of Mother <hi>Shipton.</hi> Her Mouth opens and ſhuts like a Carriers Pouch, and her Teeth are like to an old Park-Pale. Her Lips reſemble thoſe of the <hi>Hogs-Fac'd Gentlewoman,</hi> and her Tongue ſounds as loud as <hi>Bow-Bell.</hi> As for her breath, I muſt crave the help of the Poet to deſcribe it.</p>
               <l>But for her Breath, (Spectators come not nigh,)</l>
               <l>It lays about, God bleſs the Company,</l>
               <l>One Kiſs, and eighteen Words of her alone,</l>
               <l>Put down the Spaniſh Inquiſition.</l>
               <l>Thrice bleſſed we <hi>(quoth I)</hi> when I think on,</l>
               <l>The former days of perſecution;</l>
               <l>For were it free to kill, this grieſely Elf,</l>
               <l>Would Martyrs make, in compaſs of her ſelf:</l>
               <l>And were ſhe not prevented by our Prayer,</l>
               <l>By this time ſhe corrupted had the Air;</l>
               <l>The Man in the <hi>Bears-skin,</hi> baited to Death,</l>
               <l>Would chooſe the Dogs much rather than her Breath.</l>
               <p>Then for her Neck, it is like a pair of Stairs up to a Belfry, and her ſhoulders able to bear the biggeſt Jeſt that can be put upon them. Her Dugs are like two ore-worn Foot-Balls, and her ſides re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the planks of a Cheeſe-preſs. Her Waſt would waſte half an hours time to go about it, being tall and ſlender as a Windmill-Poſt. Her Belly is like to the Tun at <hi>Heidleburge</hi> and her Buttocks and Thighs correſpondent thereunto. In brief, ſhe is one made up of Natures moſt deformities, a natural Vizard, like a Winters Apple ſhrunk up together, and half rotten.</p>
               <p>The young Gentlewoman laughed very heartily at <hi>Ricardo</hi>'s deſcription of this Lady Errant, and thought it might be more Conſonant to the truth than that delivered by Sir <hi>Billy.</hi> That <hi>Ricardo (ſaid ſhe)</hi> perhaps may be the reaſon that your Maſter doth not carry the picture of his Miſtreſs along with him, as formerly Knights Errant were wont to do, by which they uſed to Vindicate their Beauties in Juſts and Tournaments againſt all oppoſers. It would not (ſaid <hi>Ricardo</hi>) be worth a painters time to beſtow ſo much coſt on ſo ill-favoured a piece. And I ſuppoſe my Maſter Fancies her more by imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, than any thing really what ſhe is.</p>
               <p>Whilſt they were thus diſcourſing, old <hi>Thomaſio</hi> (Sir <hi>Billy</hi>'s Father) having heard of the encounter his Son was to perform with the Coroner (to whoſe Town Fame had trumpetted the report) he reſolved now to be even with him, and to take ſuch a courſe as ſhould for ever ſpoil his Knight-Errantry. He therefore being Armed with the Authority of a Juſtice of the Peace, and attended by three or four luſty fellows, ſeized upon Sir <hi>Billy</hi> unawares; and with an angry countenance, ſcattered in ruddy flakes of Wrath, like to a chafed Boar whom eager Hounds have at a Bay, he thus ſpake to him.</p>

And thither Sirrah ſhalt thou go, if thou wilt not be ruled, maugre all the Witchcraft of thy doubry Squire <hi>Ricardo,</hi> who by his wicked ſpells ſtole away my Horſes from the Inn, whom I will cauſe to be puniſhed in a more exemplary manner than thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ricardo</hi> heard all theſe words, but truſting to the vertue of his <hi>Ring,</hi> he feared not what <hi>Thomaſio</hi> could do unto him. But Sir <hi>Billy</hi> was ſtruck with ſuch a deep amazement at this ſudden ſurprizal, as if he had ſtared on the <hi>Gorgons</hi> Face, and lookt like <hi>Circes</hi> Priſoners when they found themſelves Metamorphiſed into Beaſts; at laſt recovering the uſe of his ſpeech, he thus ſpake to old <hi>Thomaſio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unhappy Father, deſtructive to thy Country, and envious to poſterity that is to come who by thy obſtinacy wilt deprive after Ages of the benefit they might have received by my unconquerable Valour. But the Juſtice ſeeing him to run into his former extravagancies, and being now wearied with his impertinencies, he reſolved to ſend him by force home with his Father, and therefore bid him prepare to go, and that willingly, or elſe he would take ſuch a courſe with him, as ſhould for ever ſpoil his Knight Errantry.</p>
               <p>But Sir <hi>Billy</hi> pleaded it was againſt the Law of Arms to deal Injuriouſly with Knights Errant, who ought to be hoſpitably received where-ever they come, as Men who had denoted themſelves for the good of their Country, and that they were above any Law of Juſtices, nor under the Cogniſance of any Magiſtrate, as being fellows to Kings and Princes, many of which had been of that profeſſion themſelves. But the Juſtice would not ſuffer him any longer to run on in his wild extravagancies, but commanded his Servants to lay hold of him, and alſo to fetch in <hi>Ricardo,</hi> that they might be both pack't away toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but this was eaſier commanded than performed, for <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſlipping on his <hi>Inviſible-Ring</hi> was no where to be ſeen; yet conſidering the Juſtice was now about to order them ſower ſauce to their ſweet Meat, he was reſolved to have one bout with them before he went, and therefore whilſt old <hi>Thomaſio</hi> was making his complaint to the Juſtice, <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſtanding behind, clapt his hand on his Mouth ſo often on and off, that the old Man could ſay nothing but <hi>fa ſi ſum;</hi> whereupon the Juſtice taking him to be an old doating Fool, and that his Son was the more excuſable, as taking his folly originally from his Parents; he therefore bid him hie him Home again, and both of them ply their Buſineſs better, or elſe inſtead of being pittyed for their folly, they might be ſoundly laſht for their Knavery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ricardo</hi> liſtned very attentively to the Juſtices diſcourſe, and ſeeing he was ſo liberal of his Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping chear, he was reſolved to beſtow a caſt of his office upon him; ſo ſtepping unto him, he ſo pulled and tweaged the Juſtice by the Noſe, that he roared and bellowed like a <hi>Col<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>heſter-Bull.</hi> Now was the whole Houſe in a great Conſternation, hearing the Juſtice ſo to take on; Old <hi>Thomaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> all the while crying out upon <hi>Ricardo,</hi> calling him Witch, Wizard, Negromancer, Sorcerer, Soothſayer, Charmer, Devil, and all the other opprobrious names he could reckon up.</p>
               <p>The Juſtice herewith was in a terrible Scare, and commanded <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſhould be immediately laid hold on; but being ſearch't for in every place he could no where be found. Sir (ſaid <hi>Thomaſio</hi>) this <hi>Ricardo</hi> is the left hand of the Devil, a right <hi>Lancaſhire Witch,</hi> who can change himſelf into what ſhape he pleaſes; and who knows but that he may turn himſelf into a <hi>Flea,</hi> and ſo skip into your Daughters Bed; I tell you it is a dangerous thing, and if ſhe ſhould prove with Child, a Man might eaſily gueſs who was the Father.</p>
               <p>The whole Company could not forbear laughing at <hi>Thomaſio</hi>'s diſcourſe, but the Juſtice was more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated againſt him than before, thinking their whole deſign to be more out of Knavery than ſimplicity, and therefore commanded that both <hi>Thomaſio</hi> and Sir <hi>Billy</hi> ſhould be ſet in the Stocks, whilſt <hi>Ricardo</hi> was looking up to accompany them, and then he would take ſuch order with them as he thought fitting. But the Stocks happening to be broken at that time, the Conſtable to ſecure them put them both in the Cage, which ſo exaſperated our Knight Errant, that he ſwore by the fiery Falſhion of bloody <hi>Mars,</hi> he would either free himſelf from that captivity, or loſe his Life in the Adventure. And ſo having all his thoughts bound up in Choller, like mad <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> in a great fury, he ran with all his might againſt the Bars of the Cage, and like another <hi>Bajazet</hi> beat out his Own Brains.</p>
               <p>Old <hi>Thomaſio</hi> ſeeing what had happened, was ſtruck into a marvellous aſtoniſhment, ſo transformed with Wonder, that he ſtood like to a breathing Stone. The Juſtice hearing what had happened, went
